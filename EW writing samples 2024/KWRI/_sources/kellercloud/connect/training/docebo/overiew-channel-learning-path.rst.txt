Channels and Learning Paths
===========================

The following information should help you to determine when to create a Channel or a Learning Path for your content.

Channel
^^^^^^^

A Channel is a container that holds a collection of learning assets in support of a topic, role or community. The goal of a Channel is to help users easily find information.

Some examples of assets are: courses, videos, links, Learning Paths, Playlists, documents, PDFs, peer feedback, coach and share, and user generated content.

A Channel should be used when your content meets the following criteria:

* There is a larger selection of content that needs to grouped together by topic, role, or community.

* Access to the wider group of content need to be limited to a role or community.

* The collection of content does not solve a specific learning problem, and instead, provides solutions for multiple learning problems that fall under a topic, role, or community.

* Some of the content, but not all, may need to be taken in a specific order.

* Learners do not need or are not required to complete all the learning content included in the channel.

* The focus is on informal consumption and access of learning content.

Learning Path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Learning Path is a series of online courses that are taken in a specified order. Learning Paths can be added to the appropriate Channels. The goal of a Learning Path is to help a user learn a specific behavior or skill.

A Learning Path should be used when your content meets the following criteria:

* There is a specific learning problem that needs to be solved.

* The learning experience is designed for or needs to be assigned to specific people or roles.

* The learning experience builds on what is learned and needs to be taken in specific order.

* Completion needs to be tracked and documented.

* The structure is on-demand or blended (on-demand AND webinar, virtual classroom, or livestream).

* The focus is on formal consumption and completion of learning content.
