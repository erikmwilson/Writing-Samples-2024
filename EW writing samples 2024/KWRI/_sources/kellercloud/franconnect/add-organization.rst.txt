Add an Organization
===================

For the first phase of FranConnect, synchronization between organizations created in FranConnect and AMS organizations are requested through the API.

To add a new Business Center or Market Center to FranConnect, contact the Data Team. Requests for new organizations are processed every 24 hours at 10 PM.

When creating a new organization, make sure you choose the correct region. The region defines whether the Market Center is WorldWide or KWRI. Any update to a region (for example, the region profile is updated, a new region is opened, a region is closed), must be communicated to the Data Team and is updated manually on a case-by-case basis.

.. note::

   The following regions are not valid and should not be used:

   * Arkansas

   * California, Orange Co.

   * Germany

   * KWRI

   * Southern Arizona

Use the Parent Organization value to connect a Business Center to a World Wide or a KWRI Market Center.

After an organization is created in FranConnect, you can edit selected information in the FranConnect user interface.
