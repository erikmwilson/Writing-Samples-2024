Edit a Market Center
====================

After a new Market Center has been added to FranConnect, you can edit it in FranConnect. For more information, see :ref:`add-organization-franconnect`.

To edit a Market Center, complete the following steps:

.. include:: franconnect-login.rst

#. Click on the **Market Center Number** or **Entity Name** to edit that Market Center.

#. On the **Market Center Info** page, click **Modify**.

#. Edit the Market Center information at necessary. The following fields have some special considerations:

   * **Region** - The parent Region for the Market Center. The Region defines whether the Market Center is WorldWide or KWRI. Any update to a Region (Region profile is updated, a new Region is opened, a Region is closed), must be communicated to the Data Team and is updated manually on a case-by-case basis.

     .. note::

        The following regions are not valid and should not be used:

        * Arkansas

        * California, Orange Co.

        * Germany

        * KWRI

        * Southern Arizona

   * **State** - Select a state from the pre-defined list. WorldWide Market Centers do not require a state value.

   * **Country** - Select a country from the pre-defined list. WorldWide Market Centers do not require a country value.

   * **Opening Date** - This value becomes the Start Date in the KW AMS database. Original Open Date in the KW AMS database is kept empty.

#. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page,
