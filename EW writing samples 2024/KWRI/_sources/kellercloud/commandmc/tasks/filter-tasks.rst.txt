Filter Tasks
============

While you are managing your tasks in Command, you may need to find specific tasks. Instead of scrolling through your list or tasks to find the tasks you are looking for, you can use filters.

To filter tasks, complete the following steps:

.. include:: tasks-mc-login.rst

#. Click the **Recruits** tab, at the top of the page.

#. From the **View Tasks** drop-down, select either *My Tasks** or **All MC Tasks** to display only your tasks or all Market Center tasks.

#. Click either **Checklist Tasks** or **Other Tasks**.

#. Click the status of tasks to display, **To Do**, **Completed**, **Archived**, or **Expired**.

#. Click the filter icon |filter-icon| at the top of the page.

   .. |filter-icon| image:: ../../../images/filter-icon.png

#. On the filters fly-out menu on the right side of the page, select time frame, enter a date range, or select a recruit from the drop-down list. To remove filters, you can either remove them individually or click **Clear All** at the bottom of the fly-out menu to remove all of the filters.

#. Click **Apply**.

   The tasks are filtered and the total number of applied filters appears next to the filter icon. You can click the **X** to delete these filter.
