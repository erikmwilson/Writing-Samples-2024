Create Broker Groups and Assign Compliance Checklists
=====================================================

As agents are creating Opportunities and managing their transactions in Command, they  must upload documents for compliance approval. Before they can do this, the Market Center must create a checklist of all of the documents that are needed.

* For more information, see :ref:`create-compliance-checklists-settings-commandmc`.

* For more information, see :ref:`edit-compliance-checklists-settings-commandmc`.

You can create Broker Groups for your Market Center, assign Compliance Coordinators and Assistant MCAs to each group, and assign each of your checklists to the Broker Groups. Using Broker Groups, you can restrict access for Compliance Coordinators/Assistant MCAs to be only able to review Opportunities that are using those specific checklist types.

* If your Market Center has multiple brokers, you can use Broker Groups to limit the transactions that each Compliance Coordinator/Assistant MCA has access to.

* If you have Business Centers that are far from the Market Center, you can create compliance checklists that are specific to the Business Center, and assign local Compliance Coordinators/Assistant MCAs to those checklists.

.. note::

   * MCAs have automatic access to all Broker Groups. Assistant MCAs must be added to the broker groups they need access to.

   * After you assign checklist types to a Broker Group, it immediately restricts access to review Opportunities using those checklist types.

   * If you do not assign Broker Groups, every Compliance Coordinator/Assistant MCA is able to review the compliance for Opportunities of all checklist types.
