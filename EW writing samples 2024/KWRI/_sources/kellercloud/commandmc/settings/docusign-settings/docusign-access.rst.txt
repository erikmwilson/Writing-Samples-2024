Enable DocuSign Access for Your Associates
==========================================

In order for your associates to have the ability to use DocuSign during their transaction process, you as the MCA will need to enable DocuSign access within Command.

following steps:

#. On the **Market Center Registration** pop-up click **Send Registration Email**.

   .. note::

       The pop-up displays the Market Center's **klrwxxx@kw.com** email address. It is not possible to use any other email address for your Market Center's DocuSign account.

#. A DocuSign invitation email is sent to this email address. Open the email and click **Accept Invite**.

#. On the DocuSign **Activate Your Account** pop-up, enter your password for your DocuSign account and choose a password recovery validation question and answer. Click **Activate**.

#. On the next screen, click the **DocuSign Customer Agreement** link, to review the terms and conditions of your new DocuSign account. Click **Accept Agreement** after you have reviewed the customer agreement.
