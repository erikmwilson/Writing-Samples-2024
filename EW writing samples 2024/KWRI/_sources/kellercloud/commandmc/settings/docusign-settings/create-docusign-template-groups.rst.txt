Create Your Market Center Template Sharing Group in DocuSign
============================================================

When using DocuSign, the agents in your Market Center need access to a form that has not been added in DocuSign. You can create templates (forms that you manually upload and label) and share them with your agents using a template sharing group.

To create a template sharing group in DocuSign, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../settings.rst

#. On the left-hand Settings pane, click **CommandMC Settings** to display the
   CommandMC settings.

#. Click **DocuSign Settings**.

#. Select your **Market Center** from the drop-down.

#. Click the arrow to the far right of the **Create Market Center Group** heading and then click **Create Group**.

#. On the **Create Market Center Group** pop-up, (the **Market Center Group Name** is not editable) click **Create Group**.

After you have created your Market Center template group, you can create custom templates in DocuSign and share them with your new group.
