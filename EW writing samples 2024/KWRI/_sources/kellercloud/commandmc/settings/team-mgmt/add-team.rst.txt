Add a Team
==========

Market Center Administrators (MCAs), Assistant Market Center Administrators (AMCAs), System Admins, and Legal users can manage the teams, team members, and guests in your Market Center. Teams are used in Command apps and affect KWRI Awards.

To add a team, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../settings.rst

#. On the left-hand Settings pane, click **CommandMC Settings** to display the
   CommandMC settings.

#. Click **MC Team Management**.

   .. note::

      If you are a member of more than one Market Center, select your Market Center from the drop-down list.

#. On the **MC Team Management** page, click **Add Team**.

#. On the **Add Team** window, enter the **Team Name**, **Rainmaker**, **Start Date**, and transfer production if applicable.

   Status defaults to **Active**.

   The **Start Date** defaults to the current date but can be changed to the date the team was actually formed - as far back as the beginning of the current year.

   For teams that transferred to Keller Williams as a team, you can enter their **Non-KW Transfer Units** and **Non-KW Transfer GCI**. Refer to the award policy for information on what production is allowed to be counted in the transfer amounts.

   The transfer units and GCI are not for KW teams transferring between market centers. For those teams, you transfer the entire team to the new market center. For more information, see Transferring a Team.

#. Click **Save Changes**.

   The team is saved and you can now manage the team members.
