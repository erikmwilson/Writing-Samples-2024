Transfer a Team to a Different Market Center
============================================

Market Center Administrators (MCAs), Assistant Market Center Administrators (AMCAs), System Admins, and Legal users can transfer teams from one KW Market Center to another.

When a team transfers from one market center to another, the team should be transferred to the new market center instead of the new market center creating a new team. This ensures that transactions in both market centers have the same team ID for awards purposes If a new team is created, the production from each market center will be counted separately.

.. note::

   A team in **Pending Transfer** status cannot be edited. The only option available for the team is to cancel the transfer request.

To transfer a team, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../settings.rst

#. On the left-hand Settings pane, click **CommandMC Settings** to display the
   CommandMC settings.

#. Click **MC Team Management**.

   .. note::

      If you are a member of more than one Market Center, select (from the drop-down list) the Market Center with the team you want to transfer.

#. On the **MC Team Management** page, find the team you want to transfer using the search box and the **Show** drop-down menu and click on the team name.

#. On the **Team Details** page, click the **Transfer Team**.

#. On the **Transfer Team** window, select the **Market Center** to transfer the team to.

#. Click **Transfer Team**. A transfer request is sent to that Market Center.

   .. note:

      To cancel a transfer request, on the **Team Details** page, click **Cancel Transfer Request** and then **Yes, Cancel Request** on the confirmation page.
