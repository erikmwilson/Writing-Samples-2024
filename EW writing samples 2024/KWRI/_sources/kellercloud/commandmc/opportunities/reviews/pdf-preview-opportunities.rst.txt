Compliance Request PDF Tool
===========================

Market Centers review submitted compliance checklists in Command. Agents can use Dotloop or DocuSign (or a more traditional way) to complete their documents and import them into Command. After agents add all of the required, completed documents, they submit the documents for review. Market Center Administrators, Assistant MCAs and Compliance Coordinators review the documents in submitted checklists, and either accept them or return them to the agent.

For more information, see :ref:`review-compliance-opportunities-commandmc`.
