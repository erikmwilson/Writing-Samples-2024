Compliance Folder Messaging
===========================

Leadership can use compliance folder messaging to contact agents about compliance for a specific Opportunity. For example, you can use messaging to give an agent more detail about missing or rejected compliance documents.

Agents can also tag leadership in these messages if they have compliance questions. Messages show up in Command notifications.

To find a submitted compliance request, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-mc-login.rst

#. At the top of the page, click the **Compliance Requests** tab to see a list of all submitted compliance requests.

#. Find the correct compliance request.

   For more information, see :ref:`search-compliance-requests-opportunities-commandmc`.

#. Click **Review**, on the compliance request card.

To Send a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. For the first message, click **Add Comment**, at the top of the compliance checklist.

#. On the **Checklist Comment** pop-up, enter your message and click **Add Reply**.

   .. note::

      Use the **@** sign to notify a specific agent. Choose the person you want to sent the message to from the resulting drop-down list.

      When you type the **@** sign the drop-down contains any team member that is assigned to the Opportunity.

      If you do not use an **@** mention, the recipient of the message does not get a notification about your message.
