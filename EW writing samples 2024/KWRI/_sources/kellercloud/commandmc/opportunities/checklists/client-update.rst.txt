Configure Client Updates for an Individual Opportunity
======================================================

For an Opportunity, you can automatically send your clients daily updates on any checklist activities that have been performed.

This includes any activities that have been completed since the previous email. In the first email, all completed activities that have been flagged for communication are included. The email also includes the date and time each activity was completed.

You are able to choose which activities are included in the email. By default, no activities are included in the email. For more information see :ref:`create-checklists-opportunities-commandmc`.

.. note::

   Email updates are sent only if an activity has been completed.

This setting can be set globally for all of your contacts or you can set this for each individual contact. Individual settings supersede global settings.

For more information about global client update settings, see :ref:`client-update-settings-command`.

Emails are formatted using a default email template. For more information about Command emails, see the following topics:

* :ref:`emails-track-applications-settings-command`
