Search Recruits
===============

While you are managing your recruits, you may need to find a specific recruit. Instead of searching through your Phases and Stages to find the recruits you are looking for, you can search for the recruit.

To search recruits, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../recruits-mc-login.rst

#. Click the **Recruiting Pipeline** tab, at the top of the page. Your recruit cards are organized by Phase, Stage, and the currently selected Sort pattern.

#. Select how you want to search for the recruit using the drop-down beside the search bar. You can search recruits based on the following attributes:

   * All

   * Name

   * City

   * Postal Code

   * Email

#. Enter the search information for the desired recruit. After you locate the recruit card, click the recruit name to view the recruit details.

To move between Recruit details in the same stage, click **Previous Recruit** or **Next Recruit** at the top of the recruit details page.
