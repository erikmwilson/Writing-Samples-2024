Sort Recruiting Pipeline Cards
==============================

While you are managing your Opportunities, you may want your recruit cards to display in a certain order within your Phases and Stages.

To sort recruit cards, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../recruits-mc-login.rst

#. Click the **Recruiting Pipeline** tab, at the top of the page. Your recruit cards are organized by Phase, Stage, and the currently selected Sort pattern.

#. From the **Sort By** field, select one of the sort options. All cards, in all Phases and Stages are sorted by that option.

#. To return to the default sort, select **- -**.

To move between Recruit details in the same stage, click **Previous Recruit** or **Next Recruit** at the top of the recruit details page.
