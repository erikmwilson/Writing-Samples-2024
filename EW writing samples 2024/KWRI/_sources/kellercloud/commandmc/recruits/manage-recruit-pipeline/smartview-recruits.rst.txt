Create Smartviews for Recruiting Pipeline
=========================================

When you use a set of filters often, save that set of filters as a SmartView. You can then access that set of filters without having to reset them each time.

To create Smartviews for recruits, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../recruits-mc-login.rst

#. Click the **Recruiting Pipeline** tab, at the top of the page. Your recruit cards are organized by Phase, Stage, and the currently selected sort pattern.

#. After the desired filters have been selected, click the **Smartview** drop-down and select **Create Smartview**.

   For more information on filtering recruits, see :ref:`filter-pl-recruits-mc`.

#. Name your SmartView, then click **Save Smartview**. To access this Smartview in the future, click the **Smart View** drop-down at the top of the Recruits Pipeline and choose it from the list.
