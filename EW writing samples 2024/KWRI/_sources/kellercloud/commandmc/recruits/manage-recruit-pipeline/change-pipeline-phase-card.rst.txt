Change the Recruit's Phase or Stage
===================================

To change the position of a recruit in the Pipeline, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../recruits-mc-login.rst

#. Click the **Recruiting Pipeline** tab, at the top of the page. Your recruit cards are organized by Phase, Stage, and the currently selected Sort pattern.

#. Search for the correct recruit. For more information, see :ref:`search-pl-recruits-mc`.

#. Drag the card (using the six dot handle |drag-icon|) to the correct stage. If you need to move it to another phase, drag the recruit to the correct phase above the stages. This moves the recruit to the first stage of that phase.

   Alternately, click the ellipses icon |menu-options-icon| for that recruit and select **Change Pipeline Phase**. On the **Move to another stage** window, select a new **Phase** or **Stage**, and click **Save**.
