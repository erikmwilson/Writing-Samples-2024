Link Recruit to BrokerMetrics®
==============================

To automatically pull recruit production information from BrokerMetrics, you must link the specific recruit to their information in BrokerMetrics.

To link a recruit to BrokerMetrics, complete the following steps:

.. include:: brokermetrics-mc-login.rst

#. At the top of the **Production** tab, click **Link BrokerMetrics Record**.

#. On the **Suggested BrokerMetrics®** window, select the correct agent record and click **Link Record**.

   You receive a **BrokerMetrics® Record Linked** confirmation message.
