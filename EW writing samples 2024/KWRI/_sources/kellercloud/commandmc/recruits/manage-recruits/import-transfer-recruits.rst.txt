Transfer Existing Recruits Records into the Import Recruits Template
====================================================================

To import recruits from an outside source, you need to manually move recruits from an existing recruits spreadsheet to the CommandMC import recruits template.

You can transfer recruits from any system that exports recruits into a spreadsheet with the .CVS format.

To transfer the recruits from an exported spreadsheet to the recruit template spreadsheet, complete the following steps:

1. Open the two spreadsheets side-by-side. For more information on how to download the import recruits template, see :ref:`import-recruits-cmc`.

#. On your export file, select the cell of the first contact (not the column title).

#. Scroll to the cell of the last contact in the same column.

#. While holding the Shift key, on your keyboard, select the last cell in that same column. This will select every cell in that column.

#. Copy the selected cells.

#. On the Command Contact Import Template, select the first empty cell, in the corresponding column, and paste the cells.

   This transfers the information from that column, into the Command Contact Import Template. Follow these steps to transfer each column of information into the the blank template.

   .. note::

      If you are entering a Postal Code that begins with a zero, you must format the cells to display as text fields (Excel and Numbers removes the first zero otherwise).

#. Fill in any additional information, then save the import recruit template as a .CSV file to a designated location.
