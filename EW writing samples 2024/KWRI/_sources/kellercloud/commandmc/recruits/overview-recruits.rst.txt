Recruits Overview
=================

With Recruits, you can track all interactions with potential KW associates. Recruits consists of phases that are subdivided into stages. Within each stage you can create a checklist of tasks.

A recruit begins at the first stage of the first Phase. As the checklist tasks are completed within a stage, the recruit is moved to the next stage. When all the stages in a phase are completed, they are moved to the next phase, until they finally either join your Market Center or are removed from the pipeline.

You can add recruits manually one at a time (:ref:`add-recruit-recruits-cmc`) or import multiple recruits using CSV files (:ref:`import-recruits-cmc`).

Recruits consists of the following tabs:

The **Recruit Management** tab contains a list view of all the recruits in your database. The tab displays some basic recruit information. You can click on a recruit name to see the recruit details. Recruits listed on this tab are not necessarily in the Pipeline yet, but can be added.
