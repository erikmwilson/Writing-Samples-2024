  * Profit Share Contribution for each Market Center

  * COPS (Company Dollar to Profit Share ratio, [PS Contr]/[Co$]) for each Market Center. This is used to calculate each associate’s PS contribution ([Associate Co$]*[COPS]

  * Associate’s Company Currency for each person in each Market Center

* Profit Share Level percentage distribution

* Profit Share Tree

* Negative Profit Share - The sum of associate’s escrow balance for all months for the current year. It is adjusted by a MC based on cancelled/mistakenly submitted transactions, etc.

The Profit Share Calculator outputs the following values:

* Total Profit Share for each Market Center (sum of all agent’s profit share)

  * PS calculator compares agents total co$ to MC total
