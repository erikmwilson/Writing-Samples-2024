Month End Close Overview
========================

Month end close is the process of finalizing finance numbers and letting KW know that everything for a given month is final. The month end close is must be completed by the end of the 3rd business day of the month. It is recommended that MCAs review their numbers each Friday to make sure everything is in balance weekly so errors are caught before the end of the month. The month end close **Overview** tab is continually updated so that MCAs can check their numbers at any point in time.

To successfully complete the month end close process, the Market Center must confirm the following:

* All transactions closed for the month are properly accounted for

* All accounting entries are properly entered

* New Listings are properly accounted for

* The market center roster is current and accurate

After the period is closed, the transactions, roster and accounting data for that period cannot be changed. This is due to the monthly calculation of profit share. If an error is found, an adjustment must be made in the current period to offset the error.
