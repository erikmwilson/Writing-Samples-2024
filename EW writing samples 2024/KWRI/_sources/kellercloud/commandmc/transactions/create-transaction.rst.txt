Add a New Transaction
=====================

Sometimes it is necessary for a Market Center to enter transaction that are not submitted through Opportunities. Because all transactions also require documents, this manual entry method also triggers a compliance event to provide the path for uploading documents.

Transactions, regardless of source, display on the Market Center's transactions dashboard.

While adding a new transaction, you can save the you progress and return to complete the transaction later as long as you complete the minimum fields required for each section and the information is valid.

After all required fields are completed for the entire transaction and all the validation rules are passed the status is changed from **Open** to **Approved** (for a manual transaction) or submitted for a commission from Opportunities.

After the status is no longer **Open**, the transaction from that point forward must always be complete and in balance. The transaction cannot be placed back in open status

When the transaction is set to **Submitted** or **Approved** the written period is entered.
