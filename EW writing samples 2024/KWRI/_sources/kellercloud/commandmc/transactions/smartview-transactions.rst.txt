.. include:: transactions-mc-login.rst

#. Click the **Transaction** tab at the top of the page.

#. After the desired filters have been selected, click the **Smartview** drop-down and select **Create Smartview**.

   For more information on filtering recruits, see :ref:`filter-transactions-commandmc`.

#. Name your SmartView, then click **Save Smartview**. To access this Smartview in the future, click the **Transactions** drop-down at the top of your transactions list, and choose it from the list.
