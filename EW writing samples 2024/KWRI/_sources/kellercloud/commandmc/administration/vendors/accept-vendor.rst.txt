Add Vendor Added by Agent (Market Center Leadership)
====================================================

When a new vendor is added during Opportunity creation, that vendor is added to the agent's personal version of the vendor database. Market Center Leadership can then add the vendor to the Market Center database so they can be accessed by anyone in the Market Center.

To add a vendor added by an agent, complete the following steps:

.. include:: admin-mc-login.rst

#. In the vendor details, click **Add Contact**.
