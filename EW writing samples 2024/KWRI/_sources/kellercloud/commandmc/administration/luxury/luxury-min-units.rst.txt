Adjust Minimum Units Required for Luxury Eligibility (Market Center Leadership)
===============================================================================

Using CommandMC, Market Center Leadership (this includes the MCA, AMCA, Operating Principal, Team Leader, and Assistant Team Leader roles) have the ability to adjust the minimum amount of units sold (in the last 24 months) required for an agent to become a Luxury agent. This number sets the limit for the entire Market Center. It is recommended to make this adjustment only once a year, to keep consistency throughout the twelve months.

To adjust the minimum transactions required for luxury eligibility in your Market Center, complete the following steps:
