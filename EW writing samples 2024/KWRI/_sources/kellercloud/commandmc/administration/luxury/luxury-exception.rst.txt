Submit Luxury Agent Exception Request (Market Center Leadership)
================================================================

Using CommandMC, Market Center Leadership (this includes the MCA, AMCA, Operating Principal, Team Leader, and Assistant Team Leader roles) have the ability to submit exception requests on behalf of agents to be allowed into the Luxury program. For example, an exception request can be submitted when a new agent is joining KW and their Market Center is aware that they were a luxury agent prior to joining KW. Exception requests can also be submitted if an agent is on the boarder line of the luxury floor price. These requests are submitted to the Regional office of the Market Center. If Regional Leadership decides to approve the exception request, the agent is added to the Luxury agent roster of their Market Center.

To submit Luxury Agent program exception requests, complete the following steps:
