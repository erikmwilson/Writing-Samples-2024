Manage Luxury Program Exception Requests (Regional Leadership)
==============================================================

Using CommandMC, Regional leaders (this includes the Regional Operating Principal, Regional Director, Regional MCA, Regional Operations Manager, Regional Staff, Regional Director Assistant, Regional MCA Assistant, and Area Director roles) are able to approve or deny requests from Market Center leadership of eligible agents and qualifying properties to be accepted into the Luxury Program. It is recommended that you check the Luxury portal at least once a week to process incoming requests from Market Center leadership.

   After the luxury request is approved the agent is moved to the Luxury roster for the office and they are labeled with a **Luxury Agent**.
