#. Click the **Library** tab, at the top of the page.

Search
^^^^^^

Use the **Search** to find specific SmartPlans. Choose the search parameter from the drop-down list:

* SmartPlan Name

* Author Name

* Description

Filter
^^^^^^

Click **Filters** to open the filters fly-out. You are able to filter the library by **Duration**, **Author**, number of **Touches**, number of **Downloads**, or by **Rating**.

Categories
^^^^^^^^^^

The SmartPlans Library contains the following categories:

* **Keller Williams** - SmartPlans that Keller Williams has authored, for example, Quarterly Call Plan. If you click this category title, it filters the library by author to only show Keller Williams SmartPlans.

* **Top Rated** - SmartPlans that have the best rating compared to the number of reviews. Clicking this category title sorts the library by rating. If a SmartPlan has five stars, but only one review, it is not featured as predominantly as a SmartPlan with four stars and ten ratings.

* **What's New** - these are the newest SmartPlans that have been published. If you click this category title, it sorts the library by published date.

After you find the correct Smartplan, :ref:`add-smartplan-commandmc`.
