#. Describe your idea, attach any screenshots or files that would help the
   product team see what you are referring to (recommended), and click Next.
   Command automatically knows which screen you are on and attaches this

   click **Post idea**.

   The idea is posted on https://ideas.kw.com, where other agents can vote
   on it. The product team review the site regularly to find ideas to
   implement in Command.
