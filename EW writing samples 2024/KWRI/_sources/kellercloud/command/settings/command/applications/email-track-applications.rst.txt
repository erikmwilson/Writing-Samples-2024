Track Your Monthly Command Email Usage
======================================

Command Email is the default service used by Keller Williams to send emails on your behalf from your KW Technology applications. Each user receives 5000 email sends per month at no charge. If your email usage exceeds 5000 emails per month, you can upgrade your Command Email subscription. Command Email is connected to SmartPlans, including custom SmartPlans, and Monthly Neighborhood Nurture.

As you start getting close to reaching your 5000 email limit for the month, you will begin receive notifications. You will receive both a Command and email notification when you reach 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95% of your monthly email usage.
If you hit your limit, you have the ability to upgrade your email subscription for the month in the KW Marketplace.

For more information, see :ref:`email-upgrade-applications-settings-command`. Click here to learn how to upgrade your Command Email subscription.

Command Email monthly limits (5000 or your upgraded amount) do not roll over to the next month. Your Command Email subscription (the email limit) will reset on the first of every month.
