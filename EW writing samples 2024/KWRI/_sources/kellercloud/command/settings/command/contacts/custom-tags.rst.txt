Custom Tags
===========

Everyone organizes their database and Sales Pipeline in a unique way. Because of this, Command gives you the ability to create custom tags and custom fields. While custom fields give you the ability to create a standardized field that can allow you to add open ended responses, if there is a label that is standard to your business, add it as a custom tag and apply it to any number of contacts or opportunities. This allows you to organize your database and Sales Pipeline in any way you choose.

To create and edit your custom tags, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../settings.rst

#. On the left-hand Settings pane, click **Command Settings** to display the
   Command settings.

#. Under **Command Settings**, click **Contacts** to display the Contacts settings.

#. Click **Custom Tags**.

#. Choose whether you want to edit the custom tags for Contacts or Opportunities (Contacts is chosen by default).

#. To create a new tag, click **Create New Tag**.

#. Complete the **Add New Tag** popup window fields, and then click **Create**.

   Your new custom tag is now ready to add to your Contacts or Opportunities.

#. To edit an existing custom tag, click the Edit |edit-icon| icon to edit the name and color of the tag and click **Save**.

.. note::

   The number of contacts or opportunities assigned to each tag displays in the **Linked Contacts** or **Linked Opportunities** column. You cannot delete a tag if there are any contacts or opportunities assigned to it. You can click on the number of linked contacts, to see those contacts in your database.
