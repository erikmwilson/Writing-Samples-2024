Configure Client Update for all Opportunities
=============================================

For an Opportunity, you can automatically send your clients daily updates on any checklist activities that have been performed.

This includes any activities that have been completed since the previous email. In the first email, all completed activities that have been flagged for communication are included.

You are able to choose which activities are included in the email. By default, no activities are included in the email.

For more information about choose specific activities, see :ref:`checklists-opportunities-command`.

.. note::

   Email updates are sent only if an activity has been completed.

This setting can be set globally for all of your contacts or you can set this for each individual opportunity. Individual settings supersede global settings.

For more information about client update settings for individual contacts, see :ref:`client-update-opportunities-command`.

Emails are formatted using a default email template.
