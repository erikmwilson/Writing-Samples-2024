Create SmartViews
=================

After you have a column and filters setup that you will use on a regular basis, you can save this setup as a SmartView. This allows quick access to that set of filters without having to reset them each time. To create a SmartView, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../contacts.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Contacts** |contacts-icon|.

   .. |contacts-icon| image:: ../../../../images/contacts-icon.png
      :height: 20

#. Click the SmartView drop-down and choose **+ Create SmartView**.

#. Enter a name for your SmartView. To make this the view that shows up by default every time you access your contacts, check the **Set As Default SmartView** checkbox.

#. Click **Save SmartView**.

#. To change the default Smartview, edit, or delete an existing SmartView, choose **Manage Smartviews** from the Smartview drop-down.
