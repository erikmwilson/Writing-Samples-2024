Export eEdge Contacts
=====================

You have the ability to export your contacts from eEdge so that you can move those contacts into Command.

.. note::

   When you export your contacts, it does not remove them from your contact database in eEdge.

To export your contacts from eEdge, complete the following steps:

1. From your **myKW** home page, go into your eEdge account by clicking the **New Leads** link under **myLeads** in the eEdge Control Panel.

#. At the top-right of the page, click **Contacts** and choose **Import/Export Contacts** from the drop-down list.

#. On the new window, click the **Export Contacts** tab.

#. In the **Export** page, you can choose to filter the contacts you want to export by **Contact Group** or **Contact Status**.

   * From the **Contact Groups** drop-down, check the box next to the group or groups that you want to export.

   * From the **Contact Status** drop-down, choose a status to export. If you select a status to filter, it only exports the contacts from the selected groups that have that status.

   .. note::

      If you want to export all of your contacts, leave the group field blank (make sure that it says **Select Options** at the top of the drop-down) and choose **All** in the **Contact Status** drop-down menu.

#. Click **Export**.

   Your contacts are exported in a .CSV file to your Downloads folder.
