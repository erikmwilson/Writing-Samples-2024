Add Leads
=========

In Contacts, leads appear in your contact database with a lead |leads-icon| icon, next to their name.

Leads populate to Command automatically from your Command agent site, mobile application, and other sources, but you can also manually add a lead.

To add an individual lead, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../contacts.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Contacts** |contacts-icon|.

   .. |contacts-icon| image:: ../../../../images/contacts-icon.png
      :height: 20

#. Click **Add Contact**, at the top right of the page.

#. In the **Add to Contacts** window, enter your contact's information and select the **Mark as Lead** checkbox. For more information, see :ref:`contacts-info-fields-command`.

#. Click **Create**, to add the lead.
