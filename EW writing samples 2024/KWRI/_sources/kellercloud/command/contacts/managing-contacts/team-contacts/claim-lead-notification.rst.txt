Claim a Lead from a Notification (Teams)
========================================

In Command, Rainmakers can automatically distribute leads to their team members through lead routing. Your Rainmaker can set up one big route, set up multiple routes for different days of the week/times of day, and you can even set up special routes for holidays or specific lead sources.

You are notified through Command and Kelle, when you have a lead routed to you, and you have a set time frame to either claim the lead through Contacts or the Command notification or to pass on the lead.

When the lead is routed to you, you get a Kelle notification, but you cannot claim the lead through Kelle. To claim the lead, you must use Command.

To claim a lead from a notification, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../../contacts.rst

#. Click the notifications |notification-icon| icon next to your profile picture. The lead notification message shows you the amount of time you have left to take action for that lead.

#. Click **Claim** or **Pass** in the notification.
