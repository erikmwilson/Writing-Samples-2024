Assess the Lead Pool (Teams)
============================

If none of the agents in the route claim a lead, the lead gos to the unassigned lead pool, which can be found on your Contacts Dashboard. The leads in the unassigned lead pool can then be manually assigned, or claimed.

To access the Lead Pool, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../../contacts.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Contacts** |contacts-icon|.

   .. |contacts-icon| image:: ../../../../../images/contacts-icon.png
      :height: 20

#. Select your Team from the **Select Team** drop-down at the top of the page.

#. Above the **Name** header, click the **Lead Pool** toggle, to turn the lead pool filter on or off.

   .. note::

      You must select your team to see the **Lead Pool** toggle button. If you are on a team, but do not see a team drop-down at the top of the page, contact your MCA to make sure you are officially on the team roster.

   When the **Lead Pool** is on, the Contacts list displays only unassigned leads.
