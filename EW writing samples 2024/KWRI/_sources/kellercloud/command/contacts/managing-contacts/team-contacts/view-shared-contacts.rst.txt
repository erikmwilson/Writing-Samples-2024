View Shared Contacts (Teams)
============================

As you are working with your team and contacts are being shared with you, those shared contacts do not automatically show in your main, Contacts view. There is a filter that displays the contacts that your teammates have shared with you, and hides all other contacts.

To view shared contacts, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../../contacts.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Contacts** |contacts-icon|.

   .. |contacts-icon| image:: ../../../../../images/contacts-icon.png
      :height: 20

#. Click **Filters** above the contact list.

#. In the **Filters** window, select **Shared with me** from the **Ownership** drop-down.

#. Click **Apply**.

   Only the contacts that have been shared with you display, until the filter is cleared.
