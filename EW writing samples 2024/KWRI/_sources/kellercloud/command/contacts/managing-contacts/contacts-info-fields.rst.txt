Contacts Information Fields
===========================

The following information can be added to a contact record within Command.

* **Select Owner**

 When you are on a team, you have the ability to give ownership of a lead or contact to your team. Team contacts and leads can be claimed, assigned, and released. Rainmakers also have the ability to send a new lead through lead routing. If you are a solo agent, you can skip this field. If you are on a team, select either your team's name or yourself.

* **Mark as Lead**

 Checking this box to indicate that this is a lead. Unchecking this box, in the future, converts the lead to a contact.

 Leads are people you have contact information for, but have not connected with yet. Communication is one-way, offer-based, and focused on getting a response and beginning a relationship.

* **Send to Lead Routing** (Teams only)

 If you are on a team, you have the option to send a new lead through lead routing. First, you must check the **Mark as Lead** checkbox to unlock this checkbox, then check **Send to Lead Routing**. You also have to give the lead a **Lead Source** (in the **Sales Pipeline** section). Without a lead source, the lead will not be routed. After you click **Create**, the lead will be routed through the routes that you have set up.
