Add a Calendar Event
====================

As you are working with a contact, you might need to setup an appointment or meeting. If you are using a Google Calendar, you can create that appointment in your calendar, directly from Command.

To add a calendar event, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../contacts.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Contacts** |contacts-icon|.

   .. |contacts-icon| image:: ../../../../images/contacts-icon.png
      :height: 20

#.  In the **Contacts** list, click the name of the contact to which you want to add an activity.

#. At the bottom right of the contact details page, click the blue circle |contacts-interactions-icon|.

   .. |contacts-interactions-icon| image:: ../../../../images/contacts-interactions-icon.png
      :height: 20

#. Above the blue circle, options will appear. Choose the **Add Calendar Event** option.

   The system takes you to a Google login page. Log in to the Google account that includes your Google Calendar.

#. After you log in, a Google Calendar event creation screen displays, with the contact's email already added and an auto-filled event title labeled "Appointment with <Contact's Name>." Edit the event information, and click **Save**.

   The event is populated on your Google Calendar.
