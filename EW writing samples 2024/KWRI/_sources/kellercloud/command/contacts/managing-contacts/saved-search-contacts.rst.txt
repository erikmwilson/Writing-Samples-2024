Create a Saved Search for a Contact
===================================

You can create a Saved Search for any of your contacts. With Saved Searches, you can set a range of search criteria, for an area your client is interested in, and the system will automatically send an email to your client whenever there is a new or updated listing in the area that meets that criteria.

.. note::

   For the initial roll-out of the Command Agent Sites, you can only create one Saved Search per contact. Your clients can log into your site and create multiple Saved Searches.

   The first time the system sends your contacts an email with a new or updated listings, they are prompted to create an account. From this account, they can view, create, or edit their Saved Searches.

To create a Saved Search, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../contacts.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Contacts** |contacts-icon|.

   .. |contacts-icon| image:: ../../../../images/contacts-icon.png
      :height: 20

#. In the **Contacts** list, click the name of the contact for which you want to create a Saved Search.

#. Click the **Saved Searches** tab, at the top right of the contact record.

#. Click **Create Saved Search**. Your client can create multiple Saved Searches through the site, but you can only create one Saved Search per contact.

#. Complete the **Create Saved Search** window to set the criteria for this Saved Search.

   .. note::

      If you need to change the email address attached to this Saved Search, you must leave the window, edit the contact's primary email address, then create the Saved Search.

#. Click **Create**.
