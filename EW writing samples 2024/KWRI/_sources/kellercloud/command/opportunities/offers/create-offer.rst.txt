Create an Offer
===============

Within Opportunities, Keller Williams has created an offer management system. When you enter offers into the system, you can use that data to improve your future offers, through reports and insights. You can create an offer for a Buying of Listing opportunity.

To create an offer, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click on the phase (Cultivate, Appointment, Active, Under Contract, Closed) within the deal type (Listings or Buyer) that contains the Opportunity.

#. Click on the Opportunity name.

#. At the top of the Opportunity page, click the **Offers & Commissions** tab.

#. Click **Add New Offer**, on the right side of the page.

#. Complete the **Create New Offer** page.

   The following fields are required to create an offer:
