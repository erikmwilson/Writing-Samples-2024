Create an Offer Comparison
==========================

Within Opportunities, Keller Williams has created an offer management system. When you enter multiple offers for a Listing into the system, you can create offer comparisons that you can either download or email to your clients.

To create an offer comparison, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click on the phase (Cultivate, Appointment, Active, Under Contract, Closed) within **Listings** that contains the Opportunity.

#. Click on the Opportunity name.

#. To compare offers, check the box next to each offer you want to add to the comparison, then click **Compare Offers**.

   * Download - Creates a live web page with the offer comparison. Use your browser functionality to either download or print this web page.

   * Email Offer Comparison - Enter the **Email Address** of the recipient, a **Subject Title** for the email, and update the **Email Message** (if necessary).

     You also have the option to **Add Attachment** and to **Send a copy to my email** (send a copy of the email to yourself).

#. Click **Send Offer**.
