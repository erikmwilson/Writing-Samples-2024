Add Documents to a DocuSign Room
================================

After you create and connect your DocuSign account in Command, you can create Rooms for an Opportunity. This creates a secure connection that allows you to import forms into Command from DocuSign so that you can submit them for compliance approval.

To add documents to a DocuSign room, complete the following steps:

#. :ref:`access-room-opportunities-command`.

#. In the DocuSign Room, click **Add** and select **DocuSign forms** from the drop-down list.

#. Enter your NRDS ID, select your MLS from the drop-down, and click **Save**.

   You only have to do this once. DocuSign saves this information going forward.

#. On the **Add Docusign Forms** pop-up, select one of the following places from which to pull the document:

   * **DocuSign Forms Library** - Forms libraries are set up by MLS and contain forms to which MLS has given you access.
   * **DocuSign Forms Group** -  Forms groups are set up by your market center and are organized based on the type of transaction.


#. From the **Select Group** drop-down list, select the group you want to pull the documents from.

#. Select the desired documents by checking them one by one or by clicking **Select All**. After the documents have been selected, click **Add**.

#. The documents are then available in the DocuSign Room.
