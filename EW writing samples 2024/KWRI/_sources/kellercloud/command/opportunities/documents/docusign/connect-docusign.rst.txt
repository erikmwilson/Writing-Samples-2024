Create and Connect Your DocuSign Account in Command
===================================================

The DocuSign integration with Command makes it easy to get forms signed and loaded into an Opportunity. Your Market Center and the DocuSign team prepares  the Market Center DocuSign account, and then enables this connection for you in Command.

.. note:

   In order to use DocuSign with Command, you must create the DocuSign account from within Command. The email address attached to your DocuSign account is a key part of your DocuSign identity. If you already have a DocuSign account, you cannot create a new KW DocuSign account with the same email address as in your existing DocuSign account.

   For more information, see :ref:`existing-docusign-opportunities-command`.

      The email address you enter here is a key part of your DocuSign identity. We recommended that you use your @kw.com email address for this, but it is not required.
