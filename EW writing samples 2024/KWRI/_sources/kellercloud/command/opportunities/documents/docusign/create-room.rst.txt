Create a DocuSign Room for an Opportunity
=========================================

After you create and connect your DocuSign account in Command, you can create Rooms for an Opportunity. This creates a secure connection that allows you to import forms into Command from DocuSign so that you can submit them for compliance approval.

.. note::

   You must create your DocuSign Rooms from within the Opportunity in Command. Rooms created directly in DocuSign cannot connect to Command.

To create a DocuSign room, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click on the phase (Cultivate, Appointment, Active, Under Contract, Closed) that contains the Opportunity.

#. Click on the Opportunity name.

#. At the top of the Opportunity page, click the **Documents** tab.

#. At the top-left of the Documents page, click **Start a Transaction**.

#. Click **Go to Transaction**.

#. On the DocuSign Rooms sign in window, enter the email address associated with your DocuSign account and click **Continue**.

#. Enter your password and click **Log In**.

#. The DocuSign Room for that Opportunity appears where you can manage the documents, people, and envelopes for the Room.
