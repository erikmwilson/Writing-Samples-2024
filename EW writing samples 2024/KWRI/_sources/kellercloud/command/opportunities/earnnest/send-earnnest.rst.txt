   If you have not created an Earnnest account, you are prompted to do so. Enter the email address you want to associate with your new Earnnest account and follow the prompts to create your account.

#. As the buyer's agent, you should have your client's contact information. Select **Yes, I have their email and phone** and click **Continue**.

   * If you just finished creating your Earnnest account, you will see a welcome screen before this step, click **Start a Payment Request**.

   * If you do not have the buyer's email and phone number, you can use the other option, which will send an invite to the designated primary agent for them to enter the required information.

#. The **Request Payment** window appears with the property address auto-filled (if you have submitted a Commission Request for the Opportunity). Enter the following information:

   * Buyer's name

   * Buyer's email address

   * Phone number where they can receive SMS text messages. The buyer's phone number must be able to receive SMS text messages in order to verify that they have set up an account to submit the payment.

   * Earnest money deposit amount

#. In the **Who's receiving the payment?** section, select the approved escrow holder from the list. Below this drop-down, select the option to confirm that the above listed escrow holder is the one on the purchase contract.

#. The email addresses showing in the **Notification Receipts** section receive receipt notifications and represent you (as the agent), the buyer, and the escrow holder. Select the option confirming that there is a **Fully executed contract**, then click **Request $(amount)**.

The buyer receives an email from support@earnnest.com with a link for them to create an account and pay the earnest money.

After the earnest money is paid, payment receipt notifications are sent to you, the buyer, and the escrow holder.
