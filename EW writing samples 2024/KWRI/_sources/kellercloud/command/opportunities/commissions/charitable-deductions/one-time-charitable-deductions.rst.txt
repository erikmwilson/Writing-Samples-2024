One Time Charitable Deductions
==============================

You can share a portion of your commission as a one-time tax-deductible donation.

When you submit a commission, if you have not entered any charitable deductions, the **Charitable Deductions** window appears. For more information, see :ref:`commissions-opportunities-command`.

#. Select the dollar amounts you want to donate to KW Cares or KWKC and click **Donate and Continue**. The donation amount is entered on the **Commissions** page.

   If there are multiple agents on the Opportunity, you can leave different amounts for each agent. Move between the agents by clicking the links at the bottom of the **Charitable Deductions** window.

   .. note::

      If you choose not to donate, click **No, Not this time** or **Skip Donation for All**.

#. On the **Offers and Commissions** tab, click **Submit**.
