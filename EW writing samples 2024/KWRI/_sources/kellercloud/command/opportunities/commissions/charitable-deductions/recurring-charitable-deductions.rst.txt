Recurring Charitable Deductions
===============================

You can share a portion of your commission as a recurring tax-deductible donation. The deductions entered are automatically pre-filled in the **Payment** section of the **Commissions** page. You can edit or remove these deductions on a per-commission basis. The deductions apply only to you and not other members of your team. Deductions submitted in Command override any deductions set up in other applications (for example, WinMORE).

To set up recurring charitable deductions, complete the following steps:

.. include:: cd-settings.rst

#. On the left-hand Settings pane, click **Command Settings** to display the
   Command settings.

#. Under **Command Settings**, click **Opportunity Settings** to display the Opportunity settings.

#. Click **Recurring Deductions**.

#. For each deduction, select either **Dollar Amount** or **Percentage** and enter the value.

#. Click **Save Changes**.

   You receive a **Your recurring deduction were updated** confirmation message.
