Search Opportunities
====================

While you are managing your Opportunities in Command, you may need to find a specific Opportunity. Instead of combining through your Phases and Stages to find the Opportunity you are looking for, you can search for the Opportunity.

.. note::

   Search is also the only way to view Opportunities that were closed more than 30 days previously and archived/lost Opportunities.

To search Opportunities, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click **All Opportunities**, at the top of the page. A list displays of all the Opportunities that you own or to which you are assigned.

#. Select how you want to search for the Opportunity using the drop-down beside the search bar. You can search Opportunities based on the following information:

   * Address

   * Opportunity name

   * Assignee

   * Contact

#. Enter the search information for the desired Opportunity. After you locate the Opportunity, click the Opportunity name to view the Opportunity details.
