Tasks
=====

Tasks in Command are used to track what you need to get accomplished for your business. Opportunity Tasks come from Opportunity checklists your Administrator or Rainmaker (if on a team) have set up in your pipelines. Opportunity tasks must have a due date assigned to show up in Tasks and for you to receive a notification when the task is due.

The following sections contain information about tasks within an opportunity.
