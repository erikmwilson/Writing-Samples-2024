Enable or Disable Personal Opportunity Pipelines (Teams)
========================================================

When you are on a team, you have a team pipeline and an individual pipeline. These pipelines are separate from each other, and after an Opportunity is created, there is no way to transfer it to the other pipeline.

When an Opportunity is attached to the team pipeline, the team Rainmaker is always the Opportunity owner and has the ability to assign as many team members to the Opportunity as needed. Each team member assigned to the Opportunity has the ability to view and edit the details. If a team member creates an Opportunity on their individual pipeline (they do not select the team when creating the Opportunity), then the Rainmaker has no visibility into the Opportunity, and other team members cannot to do anything in Command to assist.

Because of this, Rainmakers have the ability to turn off their member agents' personal pipelines to ensure all Opportunities fall under the sphere of the team:

To enable or disable agent's personal pipelines, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left-hand Settings pane, click **Command Settings** to display the
   Command settings.

#. Under **Command Settings**, click **Sales Pipeline**.

#. Click **Team Permissions**.

#. You can choose whether or not the agents on your team can have personal Opportunities that are not in your team's pipeline. This applies only within your Market Center.

   a. To enable all team members, select **Yes**.

   #. To disable all team members, select **No**.

   #. To enable specific team members, click **Select Agents** and select each team member individually.
