Filter Opportunities
====================

While you are managing your Opportunities in Command, you may need to find a specific Opportunity. Instead of searching through your Phases and Stages to find the Opportunity you are looking for, you can use filters.

.. note::

   Search is also the only way to view Opportunities that were closed more than 30 days previously and archived/lost Opportunities.

To filter Opportunities, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click **All Opportunities**, at the top of the page. A list displays of all the Opportunities that you own or to which you are assigned.

#. Click **Filters** at the top of the page.

#. When the filters fly-out menu appears on the right side of the page, select the filters by clicking the checkbox beside them or selecting them from the drop-down list. To remove filters, click on each to remove them individually or click **Clear All** at the bottom of the fly-out menu to remove all of the filters.

#. Click **Apply**.
