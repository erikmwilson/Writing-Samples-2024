Generate a Transaction Summary
==============================

At any point, as your Opportunity moves through your pipeline, you can generate a Transaction Summary. This document can be downloaded or printed to share with third parties. You are able to select and organize the information that appears on the summary.

.. note::

   Transaction Summary sheets are available only for Listing and Buyers transactions.

To generate a Transaction Summary, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click on the phase (Cultivate, Appointment, Active, Under Contract, Closed) that contains the Opportunity.

#. Click on the Opportunity Name to view the Opportunity details.

#. In the top-right corner, click **Generate Transaction Summary**.

#. On the **Generate Transaction Summary** window, select the information you want to appear on the summary by checking the correct boxes. You can also change the order of the sections by dragging and dropping them.

.. note::

   Only the Opportunity sections that contain data will be available on the **Generate Transaction Summary** window.

#. Click **Generate**.

   From the Transaction Summary preview, you can print the summary or download it as a **.pdf** file.
