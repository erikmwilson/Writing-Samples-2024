Create Smartviews for Opportunities
===================================

When you use a set of filters often, save that set of filters as a SmartView. You can then access that set of filters without having to reset them each time.

To create Smartviews for Opportunities, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click **All Opportunities**, at the top of the page. A list displays of all the Opportunities that you own or to which you are assigned.

#. After the desired filters have been selected, click the **All Opportunities** drop-down and select **Create SmartView**.

   For more information on filtering Opportunities, see :ref:`filter-opportunities-command`.

#. Name your SmartView, then click **Save Smartview**. To access this Smartview in the future, click the **All Opportunities** drop-down at the top of your opportunity list, and choose it from the list.
