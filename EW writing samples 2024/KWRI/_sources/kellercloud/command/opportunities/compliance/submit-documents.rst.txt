Submit Compliance Documents to Your Market Center
=================================================

All document compliance is handled within Opportunities. After you finish adding all of the required documents for an Opportunity compliance event, you submit the documents to your MCA, or Compliance Coordinator, who then approves or rejects the completed forms.

For more information, see :ref:`add-documents-opportunities-command`.

To submit compliance documents to your Market Center, complete the following steps:
