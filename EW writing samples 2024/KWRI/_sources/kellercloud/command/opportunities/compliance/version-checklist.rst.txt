Create a New Compliance Checklist Version for an Opportunity
============================================================

As you are working an Opportunity, something may happen to cause the deal to fall through. If this happens, we want to keep a record of the compliance documents that were completed, but you will need to move forward with the transaction and find another buyer or seller.

You can create a new compliance document checklist version in Opportunities. This allows you to start fresh with a new set of documents for the transaction, while still having the ability to access the archived documents for the buyer or seller that dropped out of the deal.

To create a new compliance checklist version for an Opportunity, complete the following steps:

.. include:: ../opportunities-login.rst

#. On the left toolbar, click **Opportunities** |opportunities-icon|.

   .. |opportunities-icon| image:: ../../../../images/applet-opportunities.svg
      :height: 20

#. Click on the phase (Cultivate, Appointment, Active, Under Contract, Closed) within the deal type (Listings or Buyer) that contains the Opportunity.

#. Click on the Opportunity name.

#. At the top of the Opportunity page, click the **Documents** tab.

#. On the left side of the page, choose the type of checklist you are creating a new version for from the Checklist Type drop-down.

#. Choose the compliance event you are creating a new checklist version for:

   * For **Listings** - Listed, Under Contract, Closed

   * For **Buyers** - Consultation, Under Contract, Closed

   * For **Leases**:

     * **Tenant**: Under Contract, Closed

     * **Landlord** - Listed, Under Contract, Closed

   Depending on the situation, you may need to create a new checklist version for more than one of these compliance events.

#. At the top of the checklist, click the compliance event name and choose **Add Version**.

#. On the **Add New Version** pop-up, enter the **Version's Name** and click **Create New Version**.

You can now add documents to the new version of the checklist. Click on the compliance event name in the checklist to access the previous checklist versions.
