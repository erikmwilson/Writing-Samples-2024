Publish a SmartPlan
===================

You can publish your custom SmartPlans to the shared SmartPlans Library in Command. After they are published, KW associates can see who the publisher is and give the published SmartPlans a rating, using a five star rating system. Anyone who has access to Command can then download your published SmartPlan and start using it in their own business. Make sure you follow :ref:`publish-best-practices-smartplan-command`.

For more information, see :ref:`create-custom-smartplan-command`.

To publish a SmartPlan, complete the following steps:

.. include:: smartplans-login.rst

#. Click the **MC Plans** tab, at the top of the page.

#. Find the correct Smartplan in the list and click the menu options icon |menu-options-icon| and select **Publish to Library**.

#. If you have included any **Add to SmartPlan** steps in your custom SmartPlan, you need to publish each SmartPlan that is included in the workflow. The system takes you through each linked SmartPlan.

   * If you included a Keller Williams default plan, these are automatically published. Click **Next**, at the top of the page.

   * If you included a custom SmartPlan, you need to add a **Description** for the linked SmartPlan and click **Next**, at the top of the page.

#. Finally, add a **Description** for the main SmartPlan you are about to publish, then click **Publish**.

Now your SmartPlan is fully published for anyone in Command to use. You can see your published SmartPlans by clicking the **Published** tab, on the My SmartPlans dashboard.
