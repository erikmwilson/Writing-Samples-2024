Add Trigger to a SmartPlan
==========================

You can add a tag as a SmartPlan trigger, then any lead/contact that you add that tag to is automatically added to the SmartPlan.

* This trigger only works in the future, meaning that if a lead/contact already has the tag, they will not be automatically added to the SmartPlan.

* You can add up to 10 contact tag triggers to a SmartPlan.

* This is only to add people to a SmartPlan. If you remove a tag from a lead/contact, it will not remove them from the SmartPlan.

* If you edit a tag in your Command Settings, that tag trigger updates automatically in SmartPlans.

* Deleting a tag in Settings also removes the trigger from the SmartPlan automatically.

* Publishing a SmartPlan to the Shared Library removes all contact tag triggers from the SmartPlan.
