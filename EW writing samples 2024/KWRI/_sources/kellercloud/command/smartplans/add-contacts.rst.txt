To subscribe contacts to a SmartPlan, complete the following steps:

#. Click the **My SmartPlans** tab, at the top of the page.

#. Find the correct Smartplan in the list and click the **Add Contacts** icon |add-recruits-icon|.

   .. note::

      If you do not see the SmartPlan you want to add contacts to, access the SmartPlans Library and add it to your list. For more information, see :ref:`add-smartplan-command`.

#. A list of contacts appears in the **Add Contacts to SmartPlan** pop-up. Check the boxes next to the names of the contacts you want to add to the SmartPlan.

   .. note::

      You can only add 50 contacts at a time to a SmartPlan. The list of contacts in the pop-up box only displays 20 contacts at a time. At the bottom of the list, use the left and right arrows to navigate through the rest of your contacts list.

   * Filter by Tag - click the **Tags** button, then check or uncheck the box next to your tags, to filter the list by tags.

   * Sort by Name - click the Sort drop-down to choose the order in which the contacts appear.

#. After you select the Recruits you want to add, click **Add to SmartPlan**.

#. Select when you want the SmartPlan to start:

   .. note::

      The Birthday and Home Anniversary SmartPlans do not include this step. These SmartPlans are initiated by the birth date and home anniversary date you add to the Recruit's record.

   * **Start all now** - The first step of the SmartPlan begins immediately, as soon as you confirm.

     For example, if you add 20 contacts to the Quarterly Call Plan, you will get 20 phone call reminders immediately.

   * **Start all on the following date** - Use the calendar widget to choose a date on which to start the SmartPlan.

     For example, if you add 20 contacts to the Monthly Neighborhood Nurture SmartPlan, all of the initial emails are sent on the date you choose.

   * **Stagger over the next few days** - Choose the maximum number of contacts, to distribute into the SmartPlan, per day.

     For example, if you add 20 contacts to the Quarterly Call Plan and choose a maximum of 5 contacts per day, you will get 5 call reminders today, 5 call reminders tomorrow, 5 call reminders on the third day, and 5 call reminders on the fourth day.


#. Click **Confirm** when you are ready to start the SmartPlan.

#. On the **Add to SmartPlan** pop-up, review the details, then click **Confirm**.
