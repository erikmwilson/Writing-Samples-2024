Unpublish a SmartPlan
=====================

After you publish a SmartPlan, you can easily unpublish and remove it from the library. Keep in mind, when agents download your SmartPlan, they are downloading a copy. Their version is not affected by you removing it from the Library. When you unpublish a SmartPlan, it does not remove it from your SmartPlans list, only the library.

You cannot unpublish/delete a SmartPlan that is linked to another SmartPlan.

To unpublish/delete a SmartPlan, complete the following steps:

.. include:: smartplans-login.rst

#. Click the **My SmartPlans** tab, at the top of the page.

#. Click **Published**, above your SmartPlans list.

#. Find the correct Smartplan in the list and click the **Delete SmartPlan** icon |delete-icon|.
