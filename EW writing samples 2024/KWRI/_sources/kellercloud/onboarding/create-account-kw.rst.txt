   A beneficiary is either a natural person or legal entity that you designate to receive payments of amounts in your Keller Williams Realty Profit Sharing Program account in the event of your death. This is not required and can be changed at any time.

#. On the **Beneficiary** page, enter your beneficiary's information.

   .. note::

      If you are married, and DO NOT designate your spouse as the beneficiary of your Profit Share and Growth Share distributions, your state may require that your spouse consent in writing to said designation in order for the designation to be upheld if challenged. If this applies to you, click **Download** in the **Consent of Spouse** section to download a Consent of Spouse form. KWRI is aware that some states do not require a Consent of Spouse, and due to the reality that such laws change and KWRI is unable to determine which state’s laws may apply to an associate’s estate, KWRI encourages any married associate designating someone other than their spouse as their Profit Share beneficiary to have the attached consent form signed by their spouse before a Notary Public.

#. Enter your signature, and click **Submit Signature**. After your signature is submitted, click **Download** to download a PDF of the Beneficiary Agreement. Click **Continue**.
