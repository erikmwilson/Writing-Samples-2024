graph requests per second by type and the return codes for each API

package is installed on all infrastructure nodes, which enables

**How do I manage the MySQL database size to prevent the
``django_sessions`` table from filling up with older and expired logs?**

To clear expired logs from the ``django_sessions`` table:

#. On the deployment host, change into the ``playbooks`` directory.

#. Run the following command, replacing `TARGET` with the name of the
   horizon containers:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ansible TARGET -i inventory/ -a "horizon-manage.py clearsessions"
