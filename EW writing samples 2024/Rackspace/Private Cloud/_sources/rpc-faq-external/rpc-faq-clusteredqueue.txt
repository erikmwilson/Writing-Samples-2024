**How does RabbitMQ recover after a single node failure?**

If the node goes offline for some time and then returns, it will
automatically rejoin the cluster with no user intervention required.

**How does a cluster recover from a catastrophic failure of all
nodes?**

As with an upgrade, the nodes should be brought back in reverse
order. However, in a case where nodes go down simultaneously, you must
manually start all nodes in quick succession to ensure that they can
identify each other, as described in `this discussion thread
<http://grokbase.com/t/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-discuss/136apcb5p3/restart-cluster
