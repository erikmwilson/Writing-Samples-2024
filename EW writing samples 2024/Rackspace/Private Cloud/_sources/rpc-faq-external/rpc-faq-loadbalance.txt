Load balancing
==============

Get answers to common technical questions about failover and high
availability for Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack (RPCO) |release|.

**Do the services need to be modified to enable load balancing in
one-arm mode?**

No.

**What load balancing options can Rackspace provide in a customer
data center?**

RPCO supports two models for load balancing in a customer data center:

  - Unmanaged Load Balancers (a.k.a customer managed)

  - Managed Load Balancers

    - Support for hardware based HAProxy

    - Support for hardware based F5 BigIP

**What is the load balancer configuration for the reference
architecture?**

The load balancers should be a high availability (HA) pair, so
that at least two load balancers are available to balance the traffic
across the infrastructure.

**Can the same load balancer be used for service and VM traffic?**

This depends on the devices being used. If the HAProxy option is employed,
those devices cannot be used to balance Data Plane traffic (they are
restricted to Control Plane only). If the F5 BigIP devies are being utilized,
those devices can be used to balance Data Plane traffic. The only limitation is
the capacity of the physical devices.

**What services should be load balanced?**

All services should be load balanced, even if the service is
running on a single container. This ensures that the traffic is managed
by the load balancer and that failovers are graceful.

**What if customers require API access to the load balancer to
manage floating IP addresses and VIP pools?**

RPCO does not provide customer API access to any Control Plane load balancers.
RPCO also does not support customer API access to the F5 Local Traffic Manager
(LTM). A separate customer-managed LTM must be configured to handle VM (Data
Plane) Load Balancing.
