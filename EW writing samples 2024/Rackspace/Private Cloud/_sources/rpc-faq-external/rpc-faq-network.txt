Get answers to common technical questions about networking for Rackspace
Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack (RPCO) |release|.

**Why does RPCO supporting OpenStack Networking (neutron) by default?**

The OpenStack community is moving forward with neutron, and RPCO
will remain in sync with community development.

**Why is RPCO using Linux Bridge plug-in?**

The Linux Bridge plug-in is known to be stable with OpenStack Networking
and can be used to create bridges within containers.

**What advantages do containers offer in configuring OpenStack
Networking?**

Namespaces, taps, tunnels, VLAN-tagged interfaces, vEth-pairs,
iptables, and other kinds of network technology are all fully functional
inside containers. Containers also provide scalability and the ability to
work around restrictions of one external network per L3 agent.

**Do I have do anything differently when networking roles
are assigned to separate networking nodes?**

In this scenario, you would modify the host ``rpc_user_config.yml`` file
with the new host(s) information under the ``network_hosts`` group.

After the new hosts are active and functional, delete the old containers,
remove the old container information from the
``openstack_inventory.json`` file, and update the neutron database to
reflect the deleted nodes.

The environment is fully configurable. While RPCO has specified groups
and populated those groups, it is possible to make changes in the
``rpc_environment.yml`` file.
