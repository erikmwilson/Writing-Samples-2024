The Rackspace Cloud Monitoring Service allows Rackspace Private Cloud
customers to monitor system performance and safeguard critical data.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The monitoring agent and scripts are downloaded by a Rackspace Cloud
Engineer during an installation or upgrade of RPC. It is then
installed via the `setup-maas` Ansible playbook
(https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/blob/master/rpcd/playbooks/setup-maas.yml).
After installation, use the `verify-maas` playbook
(https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/blob/master/rpcd/playbooks/verify-maas.yml)
to ensure that all the monitoring is configured and working as
expected. The `setup-maas` playbook is also responsible for defining
relevant checks and alarms in the Cloud Monitoring system.
