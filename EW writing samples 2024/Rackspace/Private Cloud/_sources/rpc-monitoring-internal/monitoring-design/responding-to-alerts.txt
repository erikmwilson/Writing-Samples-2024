Responding to alerts
====================

The Rackspace Monitoring Service issues an alert when a warning or
failure occurs or a threshold is exceeded. Each alert is assigned a
severity level that determines your live response time. The following
table highlights the severity levels and associated response time
guarantees offered with Core Support:

     - One hour
   * - Standard – delay in launching new instances or in interacting
       with the OpenStack API
