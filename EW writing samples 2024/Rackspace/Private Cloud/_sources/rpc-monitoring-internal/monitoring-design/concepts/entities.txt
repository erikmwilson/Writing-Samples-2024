An entity is a representation of a server or device in the Rackspace
Monitoring infrastructure (such as ``en0Rl6ATbq`` ). The entity is the
top-level hierarchy of monitoring for a server. All configured checks
and alarms for a server exist under the associated entity. Each entity
can have multiple checks. Entities are created by an automated RBA
process when a server initially reaches "Segment Configuration" status
in CORE.

Note that:

- There should always be a one-to-one mapping of a server in CORE and
  an entity in the Rackspace Monitoring API. If there is more than one
  entity for a server something is very wrong. In other words, two
  entities should never have the same URI (link to a server in CORE).

- During the entity creation process:

  - ``entityLabel`` is populated with the server name in CORE.

  - ``agentID`` is left null.

  - IP addresses are automatically associated using data from CORE.

   * - Entity
     - Description
   * - ``entityID``
     - The unique ID of an entity (starts with ``enXXXXXXXX``).
   * - Label
     - The name of the entity. Typically set to the server's name in
       CORE at creation time.
   * - ``agentID``
     - Set by the playbook to match the ``entityLabel``. Left null at
       creation time.
   * - URI
     - Link to CORE server page
   * - IP address
     - Primarily used for remote checks. Set to server's IPs in CORE
       at creation time.
   * - Managed
     - Automatically set to true for dedicated servers.
   * - Active/scheduled suppressions
     - If there is an active or future scheduled MaaS suppression for
