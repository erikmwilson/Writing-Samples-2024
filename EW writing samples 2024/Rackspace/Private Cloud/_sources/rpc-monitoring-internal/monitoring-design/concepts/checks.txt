A **check** is a high-level specification of what to monitor and how
to monitor it. Checks are the mid-level hierarchy underneath an
entity. It must return one or more metrics (data points) used by an
alarm to evaluate a current state (``OK``, ``WARNING``, or
``CRITICAL``).

The checks in an RPC environment are divided into two different
categories:

- Local checks are those run by the monitoring agent on each node,
  checking not only hardware (CPU/Disk/Memory) but also any OpenStack
  services running on that individual node. The metrics that local
  checks gather are reported by the agent to the MaaS endpoints
  through the MaaS API.

- Remote checks are initiated from the MaaS endpoints and poll the
  load balanced services from outside the environment to ensure
  availability. These checks also produce metrics which are stored by
  the MaaS endpoints.

The combination of both local and remote checks ensure that Support
Engineers are alerted when an individual service is down on a node
(wherein the overall load balanced service would still be available),
or where there are network issues that would prevent users from
reaching the services through the load balancer (even if all services
on each node are working fine).


Each check can have multiple alarms. All checks are deployed with a
``.yaml`` configuration file located in the
``/etc/rackspace-monitoring-agent.conf.d/`` directory. These
configuration files are authoritative. Any changes made to a check
through the API will be reset to the configuration file specification
when the ``rackspace-monitoring-agent`` service is restarted on the
associated server. You can use Ansible to reconfigure the monitoring
configuration and restart agents across an environment.


Check elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table:: **Check Elements**
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Element
     - Description
   * - Active/scheduled suppressions
     - Whether there is an active or future scheduled MaaS suppression
       for this checkID.
   * - checkID
     - Unique ID of a check (starts with ``chXXXXXXXX``).
   * - Details (plugin file/arguments)
     - Depends on the check type. If ``agent.plugin``, the script (file)
       and arguments are passed. ``agent.plugin`` scripts are
       deployed to ``/usr/lib/rackspace-monitoring-agent/plugins/``.
   * - Label
     - The name of the check.
   * - Monitoring zones poll
     - The region where a remote check is executed. Available
       regions are DFW, ORD, IAD, LON, SYD, and HKG.
   * - Period (frequency)
     - How often the specific check runs. All checks deployed for RPC
       runs every 60 seconds by default.
   * - Status
     - Boolean - activates or disables a check.
   * - Timeout
     - After this time, the check times out and reports a failure. All
       plugin-based checks are deployed with a 30 second timeout
   * - Type
     - RPC uses checks based on remote (``remote.{http,https}``) and agent
       (``agent.{cpu,disk,filesystem,network,plugin``}).
