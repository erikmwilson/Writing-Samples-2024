Rackspace monitoring design
===========================

The `Rackspace Monitoring Service
<https://one.rackspace.com/display/productweb/Rackspace+Monitoring>`_
helps your private cloud powered by OpenStackÂ® run at an optimal
performance level. It proactively monitors your environment,
continually checks your disk space, disk utilization, CPU idle time,
and memory capacity. It verifies that each OpenStack service is
responding to calls as intended. This service is included as part of
your Rackspace Private Cloud Core Support agreement.

The RPC monitoring agent and scripts, referred to as MaaS (Monitoring
as a Service), are installed locally on the hosts and check in with
Rackspace Cloud Monitoring endpoints through SSL at a defined
interval.
