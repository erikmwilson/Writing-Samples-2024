Host monitoring metrics
=======================

The host metrics are collected and reported via the RPC monitoring
agent. These metrics are gathered using a one-way egress communication,
meaning the agent internally reports out only. Connectivity out to the
Rackspace Cloud Monitoring endpoints is required in order to
monitor your private cloud. Additional details about the Rackspace Cloud
Monitoring platform can be found at
http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge\_center/getting-started/cloud-monitoring.

Note that the Cloud Monitoring platform is a multi-tenant system,
of which conform to current PCI certification standards. The collected
data is stored within a Cassandra database cluster across three
Rackspace data centers.
