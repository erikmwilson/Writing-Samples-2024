RPCO monitoring check, alarm, and metric details
================================================

This section provides details about all of the monitoring checks
for each Rackspace Private Cloud deployment, broken down on a
per-alarm basis. Each alarm contains one or more criteria upon
which an alert is generated, and they are broken down by status, condition,
and the message they'll send when alerted.

Additionally, where user-configurable variables are supported for a check
or specific alarm, they're denoted below with their default value.
