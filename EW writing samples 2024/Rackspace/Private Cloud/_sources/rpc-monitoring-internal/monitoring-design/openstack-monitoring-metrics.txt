OpenStack monitoring metrics
============================

The OpenStack services API uptime and metrics are set up as remote
Cloud Monitoring checks. Those checks then kick off pollers that then
query the local MaaS agent. The MaaS agent periodically obtains a list
of Rackspace Cloud Monitoring endpoints to send monitoring data to and
returns a list of metrics defined by the corresponding *check* to all
endpoints once a Rackspace polling event is kicked off.

Following is a list of network ranges of the Rackspace Cloud
Monitoring endpoints that would require ingress connectivity into the
RPC cloud:

.. list-table:: **Cloud monitoring endpoints**
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - IP
     - Endpoint
   * - 50.56.142.128/26
     - DFW
   * - 180.150.149.64/26
     - HKG
   * - 69.20.52.192/26
     - IAD
   * - 78.136.44.0/26
     - LON
   * - 50.57.61.0/26
     - ORD
   * - 119.9.5.0/26
     - SYD


The remote Cloud Monitoring system polls the locally running MaaS
agent, which in turn polls the public OpenStack API endpoint to verify
overall API functionality. Remote checks do not send credentials or
any other identifying information. The poller checks for a ``200 OK``
response code. Any other response generates an alert. These specific
monitoring checks are recommended but not a hard requirement for RPC
supportability.

The following list of TCP ports must be allowed from Rackspace Cloud
Monitoring pollers:
