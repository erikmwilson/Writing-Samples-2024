Accessing data and configuration
================================

The Rackspace Monitoring Service data is available for viewing through
the MyRackspaceÂ® portal. You also have the flexibility to work with
our support team and customize your settings in the following ways:

-  Set the frequency for how often your monitoring tests are run (e.g.
   every minute, every 5 minutes, etc.)

-  Define which ports are used for each test

-  Set the thresholds for your compute, disk and memory-related alerts
   (e.g. disk space, memory capacity, etc.)

-  Determine which members of your organization are to receive an auto-
   generated notification for each alert
