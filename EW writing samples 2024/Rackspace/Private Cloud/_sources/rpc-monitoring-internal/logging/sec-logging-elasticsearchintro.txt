Getting Started
===============

Elasticsearch is a scalable datastore with a real-time search/analytics
engine and RESTful API.

Checking current Elasticsearch version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify Elasticsearch is working properly, curl the API to receive
the current version:

 .. code-block:: console

    $ curl http://external_lb_vip_address:9200


Viewing all indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Elasticsearch stores data in an index. An index is similar to a database
in a traditional relational database. In a RPCO deployment, a single
index contains one day of indexed logs from all services in the
environment.

Retrieve a list of current indices by sending a GET request to the
Elasticsearch API:

 .. code-block:: console

    $ curl http://external_lb_vip_address:9200/_cat/indices
