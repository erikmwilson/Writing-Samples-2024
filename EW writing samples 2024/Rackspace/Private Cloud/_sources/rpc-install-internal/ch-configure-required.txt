Ansible references some files that contain mandatory and optional
configuration directives. Before you can run the Ansible playbooks to
install Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack (RPCO), you must
modify these files to define the target environment. Perform the
following required tasks:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   Complete the prerequisites <configure-req/configure-prereqs.rst>
   Configure Target host networking to define bridge interfaces and networks <configure-req/configure-target-hosts-networking.rst>
   Configure a list of target hosts on which to install the software <configure-req/configure-target-host.rst>
   Configure service credentials <configure-req/configure-service-credentials.rst>
