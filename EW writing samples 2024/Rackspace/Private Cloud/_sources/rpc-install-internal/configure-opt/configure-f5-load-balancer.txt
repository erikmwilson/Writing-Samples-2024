=====================================================
Generate an F5 load balancer configuration (optional)
=====================================================

If the Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack (RPCO) deployment
requires F5 load balancers, you must generate a configuration file and
send it to NetSec for load balancer setup.

Complete the following steps to create the configuration file:

#. Run the OpenStack-Ansible Inventory script in the ``playbooks``
   directory to generate an inventory of the hosts and containers in
   the environment, as shown in the following example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd /opt/rpc-openstack/openstack-ansible
      $ playbooks/inventory/dynamic_inventory.py  --config /etc/openstack_deploy/


#. Using the generated inventory file as input, run the configuration
   script to create the F5 configuration file, as shown in the
   following example. Replace ``INTERNAL_LB_VIP_ADDRESS`` with the
   internal IP address of the load balancer.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd /opt/rpc-openstack
      $ scripts/f5-config.py -f /etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_inventory.json -s INTERNAL_LB_VIP_ADDRESS --export


.. note::

     For additional information about generating the dynamic inventory
     file, see the `OpenStack-Ansible Inventory script`_.
