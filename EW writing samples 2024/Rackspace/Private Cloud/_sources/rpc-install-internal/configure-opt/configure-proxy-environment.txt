================================================
Configure proxy environment variables (optional)
================================================

To run the deployment framework from behind a proxy, set environment
variables so that ``pip`` and other services work as expected.

In the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_variables_defaults.yml`` file, the
following commented examples are provided in the file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ## Example environment variable setup:
   # proxy_env_url: http://username:pa$$w0rd@10.10.10.9:9000/
   # no_proxy_env: "localhost,127.0.0.1,{% for host in groups['all_containers']
   #                %}{{ hostvars[host]['container_address'] }}
   #                {% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}"
   # global_environment_variables:
   #   HTTP_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
   #   HTTPS_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
   #   NO_PROXY: "{{ no_proxy_env }}"

To use a proxy, uncomment this section and define variables as
appropriate for your environment in the
``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_variables_overrides.yml`` file.

-  Set the ``proxy_env_url`` environment variable to define the proxy so
   that ``pip`` and other programs can reach hosts beyond the proxy. Because
   Python HTTPS proxy support is limited, the preferred format for this
   variable is ``http://``. To use ``https://``, verify that
   Python programs connect as expected before continuing the
   installation.

-  The ``no_proxy_env`` variable defines addresses that should skip the
   proxy. For example ``localhost``, container IP addresses, and so on do not
   attempt to use the proxy setting. If necessary, prepend items to this
   list.

-  Items appended to ``global_environment_variables`` set environment
   variables on every host and container during the container creation
   process. Generally, it is not necessary to modify this variable.
