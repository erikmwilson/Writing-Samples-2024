===========================================
Configure Dashboard SSL settings (optional)
===========================================

Customizing the Dashboard deployment is done within the ``os-horizon``
role in the ``/etc/ansible/roles/os_horizon/defaults.main.yml`` file.

There are two options for deploying SSL certificates with Dashboard:
self-signed and user-provided certificates. Auto-generated self-signed
certificates are currently the default.

.. note::

   If F5 is used, update the certificates on the
   SSL profile for the horizon SSL virtual IP address.


Self-signed SSL certificates
----------------------------

For self-signed certificates, users can configure the subject of the
certificate by using the ``horizon_ssl_self_signed_subject`` variable. By
default, the playbook does not regenerate a self-signed SSL certificate
if one already exists on the target. To force the certificate to be
regenerated the next time the playbook runs, set
``horizon_ssl_self_signed_regen`` to ``true``. The playbook then
distributes the certificates and keys to each horizon container.

.. note::

   When self-signed certificates are regenerated, they overwrite any
   existing certificates and keys, including ones that were previously
   user-provided.


User-provided SSL certificates
------------------------------

Users can provide their own trusted certificates.

#. Copy the SSL certificate, key, and CA certificate to the deployment host.

#. In the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_variables_overrides.yml`` file, set
   the following variables:

   - ``horizon_user_ssl_cert`` - path to the SSL certificate in the
     container

   - ``horizon_user_ssl_key`` - path to the key in the container

   - ``horizon_user_ssl_ca_cert`` - path to the CA certificate in the
     container

   If those three variables are provided, self-signed certificate
   generation and usage are disabled. However, the user is responsible
   for deploying those certificates and keys within each container.
