Configure security hardening
============================

RPCO r13 applies security hardening to hosts and many services running
on those hosts during deployment. Detailed information about the
security hardening role and its application is provided in the
`OpenStack-Ansible security documentation
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/>`_.

For installation information including how to enable or disable the
feature on deployment, see
`docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/getting-started.html
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/getting-started.html>`_.
