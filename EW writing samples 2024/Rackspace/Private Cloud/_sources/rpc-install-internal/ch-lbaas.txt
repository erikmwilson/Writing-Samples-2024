==========================================
Load balancing for applications (optional)
==========================================

Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack provides basic load
balancing as a service (LBaaS) functionality to applications running
on instances within a customer cloud, in a new or existing RPCO
deployment.

The LBaaS v2 functionality is configured and deployed using
OpenStack-Ansible (OSA). For more information, see the
`OpenStack-Ansible Deployment Guide
<http://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/openstack-ansible/newton/>`_.

For information about LBaaS operations, see the `OpenStack Networking
Guide
<http://docs.openstack.org/newton/networking-guide/config-lbaas.html>`_.

For the latest information about how the RPCO LBaaS implementation
might differ from upstream, see the RPCO Release Notes.

   .. note::

      [IS THIS STILL TRUE?]

      RPCO provides LBaaS as a technical preview, which should not be
      used for production workloads. For more information about LBaaS
      limitations and restrictions, see the RPCO Release Notes.
