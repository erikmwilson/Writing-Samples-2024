======================
Configure target hosts
======================

Edit the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml`` file to
configure the target hosts.


.. warning::

   Do not assign the same IP address to different target hostnames.
   Unexpected results might occur. Each IP address and hostname must be a
   matching pair. To use the same host in multiple roles, for example
   infrastructure and networking, specify the same hostname and IP address
   in each section.

   Use short hostnames rather than fully-qualified domain names (FQDN) to
   prevent length limitation issues with LXC and SSH. For example, a
   suitable short hostname for a compute host might be: ``123456-Compute001``.

.. important::

   In Rackspace data centers, the format for the name is as follows, where
   ``CORE-ID`` is the CORE device ID number, ``category`` is the host category,
   and ``NNN`` is the host number: ``COREID-categoryNNN``. For more information
   about target host naming conventions, see: :ref:`naming-target-hosts`.

#. In the ``shared-infra_hosts`` section, configure a list that contains
   at least three infrastructure target hosts :

   .. code-block:: yaml

      shared-infra_hosts:
        603975-infra01:
          ip: INFRA01_IP_ADDRESS
        603989-infra02:
          ip: INFRA02_IP_ADDRESS
        627116-infra03:
          ip: INFRA03_IP_ADDRESS
        628771-infra04: ...

   Replace ``_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each infrastructure target host. Use
   the same net block as bond0 on the nodes, for example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      shared-infra_hosts:
        603975-infra01:
          ip: 10.240.0.80
        603989-infra02:
          ip: 10.240.0.81
        627116-infra03:
          ip: 10.240.0.184

#. In the ``os-infra_hosts`` section, configure a list that contains at least
   three infrastructure target hosts  (you can reuse previous hosts, if
   their names and IP addresses are consistent):

   .. code-block:: yaml

      os-infra_hosts:
        infra01:
          ip: INFRA01_IP_ADDRESS
        infra02:
          ip: INFRA02_IP_ADDRESS
        infra03:
          ip: INFRA03_IP_ADDRESS
        infra04: ...

#. In the ``identity_hosts`` section, configure a list of at least three
   Identity target hosts:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      identity_hosts:
        infra1:
          ip: IDENTITY01_IP_ADDRESS
        infra2: ...

#. In the ``network_hosts`` section, configure a list containing at least one
   network target host. Replace ``_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the
   ``br-mgmt`` container management bridge on each network target host.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      network_hosts:
        602117-network01:
          ip: NETWORK01_IP_ADDRESS
        602534-network02: ...

#. In the ``compute_hosts`` section, configure a list containing at least one
   compute target host. Replace ``_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the
   ``br-mgmt`` container management bridge on each compute target host.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      compute_hosts:
        900089-compute001:
          ip: COMPUTE001_IP_ADDRESS
        900090-compute002: ...

#. In the ``log_hosts`` section, configure a list containing at least one
   logging target host. Replace ``_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the
   ``br-mgmt`` container management bridge on each logging target host.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      log_hosts:
        900088-logging01:
          ip: LOGGER1_IP_ADDRESS
        903877-logging02: ...


#. In the ``repo-infra_hosts`` section, configure a list containing at least
   one repository target host. Replace ``_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of
   the ``br-mgmt`` container management bridge on each repository target host.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      repo-infra_hosts:
        903939-repo01:
          ip: REPO1_IP_ADDRESS
        907963-repo02: ...

   The repository typically resides on one or more infrastructure hosts.
   Alternatively, specify a value for the ``openstack_repo_url``
   variable in the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_group_vars.yml`` file.
   The value should contain a URL for a host with the appropriate
   layout. For example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      openstack_repo_git_url: "https://rpc-repo.rackspace.com/"

   Using ``repo-infra_hosts`` configures a local repository with the
   appropriate layout and sets ``openstack_repo_url`` for you.

#. In the ``storage-infra_hosts`` section, configure a list containing at
   least three infrastructure target hosts  (you can reuse
   previous hosts as long as their names and IP addresses are consistent):

   .. code-block:: yaml

      storage-infra_hosts:
        infra01:
          ip: INFRA01_IP_ADDRESS
        infra02:
          ip: INFRA02_IP_ADDRESS
        infra03:
          ip: INFRA03_IP_ADDRESS
        infra04: ...

#. In the ``storage_hosts`` section, configure a list containing at least one
   optional storage host. Replace ``_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the
   ``br-mgmt`` container management bridge on each storage target host.
   Each storage host also requires additional configuration to define the back
   end driver.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      storage_hosts:
        100338-storage01:
          ip: STORAGE01_IP_ADDRESS
        100392-storage02: ...

   .. note::

      The default configuration includes an optional storage host. To
      install without storage hosts, comment out the stanza beginning with
      the *storage_hosts:* line.
