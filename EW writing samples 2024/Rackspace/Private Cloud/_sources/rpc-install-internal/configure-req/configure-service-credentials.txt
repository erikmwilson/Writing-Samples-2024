=============================
Configure service credentials
=============================

By default, passwords are randomly generated when RPCO is installed.
Configure credentials for each service in the
``/etc/openstack_deploy/*_secrets.yml`` files. We recommend using the
`Ansible Vault <http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_vault.html>`_
feature to increase security by encrypting any files that contain
credentials.

.. warning::

   Adjust permissions on these files to restrict access by non-privileged
   users.

The following options configure passwords for the web interfaces:

-  ``keystone_auth_admin_password`` configures the ``admin`` project
   password for both the OpenStack API and dashboard access.

-  ``kibana_password`` configures the password for Kibana web interface
   access.

We recommend that you use the ``pw-token-gen.py`` script to generate random
values for the variables in each file that contains service credentials:

.. code-block:: console

   # cd /opt/rpc-openstack/openstack-ansible/scripts
   # python pw-token-gen.py --file /etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_secrets.yml
   # python pw-token-gen.py --file /etc/openstack_deploy/user_rpco_secrets.yml

To regenerate existing passwords, add the ``--regen`` flag.
