Prepare the deployment host
===========================

.. image:: ../figures/rpc-internal-installworkflow-deployhost.png

The Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack (RPCO) installation
process requires one deployment host. The deployment host contains
Ansible and orchestrates the RPCO installation on the target hosts.
One of the target hosts, preferably one of the infrastructure hosts,
can be used as the deployment host. To use a target host as a
deployment host, follow the steps in :ref:`target-hosts` on the
deployment host. This section assumes separate deployment and target
hosts.

.. note::

   The rpc-openstack repository includes additional features for Rackspace
   Private Cloud. It integrates with the ``openstack-ansible`` set of
   Ansible playbooks and roles. These additional features extend the
   OpenStack environment, but they are not core to deploying an OpenStack
   cloud.


Install the operating system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) 64-bit
<http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/>`_ operating system on the
deployment host with at least one network interface configured to
access the Internet or suitable local repositories.


Configure the operating system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install additional software packages and configure the network time
protocol (NTP).

#. Update the source packages:

   .. code-block:: console

      # apt-get update

#. Upgrade the system packages and kernel:

   .. code-block:: console

      # apt-get -y dist-upgrade

#. Install additional software packages if they were not installed during the
   operating system installation:

   .. code-block:: console

      # apt-get -y install aptitude build-essential git ntp ntpdate \
        openssh-server python-dev sudo

#. Configure NTP to synchronize with a suitable time source.


Install the source and dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the source and dependencies for the deployment host by cloning
the `rpc-openstack <http://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/>`_
repository into the ``/opt/rpc-openstack`` directory. Replace ``TAG``
with the current stable release tag.

   .. code-block:: console

      # git clone -b TAG --recursive https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack \
        /opt/rpc-openstack

.. note::

   Pip and Ansible are installed when the ``deploy.sh`` deployment
   script is run, and they do not need to be deployed manually at this
   time. See :ref:`deployment-playbooks`.


Configure Secure Shell (SSH) keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ansible uses Secure Shell (SSH) with public key authentication to
connect the deployment and target hosts. To reduce user interaction
during Ansible operations, key pairs should not include passphrases.
However, if a passphrase is required, consider using the **ssh-agent**
and **ssh-add** commands to temporarily store the passphrase before
performing Ansible operations.
