OpenStack-Ansible configuration files
=====================================

The following OpenStack-Ansible (OSA) configuration files are used when
installing Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack (RPCO):

- The `openstack_user_config.yml
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/stable/newton/etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml.example>`_
  file contains variables to configure target host networking and the
  Block Storage service. RPCO has host networking sections that
  specify the placement of the containers:

  - shared-infra_hosts - MariaDB and memcache RabbitMQ containers.

  - os-infra_hosts - OpenStack API minus the cinder and keystone containers.

  - storage_hosts - Where the cinder-volumes service is running.

  - repo-infra_hosts - Where a local copy of the RPCO installation packages
    are stored, and Git directories and Python wheels are stored during the
    build process.


- `user_secrets.yml
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/stable/newton/etc/openstack_deploy/user_secrets.yml>`_
  This file is renamed to ``user_osa_secrets.yml`` throughout the RPCO
  installation and is populated one time by
  ``/opt/rpc-openstack/openstack-ansible/scripts/pw-token-gen.py`` in
  order to generate randomized service credentials.

- `swift.yml
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/stable/newton/etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/swift.yml.example>`_

- `extra_container.yml
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/stable/newton/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/extra_container.yml.example>`_
