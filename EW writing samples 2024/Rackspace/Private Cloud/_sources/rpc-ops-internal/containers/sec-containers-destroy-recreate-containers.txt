 Destroying and recreating containers
======================================

Resolving some issues may require destroying a container, and rebuilding
that container from the beginning. It is possible to destroy and
re-create a container with the ``destroy-containers.yml`` and
``build-containers.yml`` commands. These Ansible scripts reside in the
``openstack-ansible/playbooks`` repository.

#. Navigate to the ``openstack-ansible`` directory.

#. Run the **openstack-ansible destroy-containers.yml** commands,
   specifying the target containers and the container to be destroyed.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack-ansible destroy-containers.yml \
      build-containers.yml OTHER_PLAYS -e container_group="CONTAINER_NAME"

#. Replace *``OTHER_PLAYS``* with the target container, and replace

#. Change the load balancer configuration to match the newly recreated
   container identity if needed.
