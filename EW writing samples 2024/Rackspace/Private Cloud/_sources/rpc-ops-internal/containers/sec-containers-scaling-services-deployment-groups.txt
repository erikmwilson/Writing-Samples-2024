 Scaling services with new deployment groups
=============================================

In any OpenStack environment installed with Ansible, Deployment Groups
reside on specific nodes. Specific groups of containers are collected
open source project services, run within containers.

For example, the ``compute_hosts ``\ deployment group holds the
``nova_compute_container``, which contains the
``neutron_linuxbridge_agent`` and ``nova_compute`` OpenStack services.
This deployment group resides on the compute node.

Users can create new infrastructure nodes, and scale OpenStack services
within containers, by generating new deployment groups. The process
requires setting up a new deployment groups inside the host
configuration files.

#. On the host machine, navigate to the directory where
   ``openstack_config`` file resides.

   This configuration file defines which deployment groups are assigned
   to each node.

#. Add a new deployment group to the configuration file. Adjust the
   deployment group name followed by the affinity values within the
   deployment group section of the ``openstack_config`` config file to
   scale services.

   .. code-block:: ini

      compute_hosts
      infra_hosts
      identity_hosts
      log_hosts
      network_hosts
      os-infra_hosts
      repo-infra_hosts
      shared-infra_hosts
      storage-infra_hosts
      storage_hosts
      swift_hosts
      swift-proxy_hosts

#. Modify the ``openstack_config`` file, adding containers for the new
   deployment group.

#. Specify the required affinity levels. Add a zero value for any
   OpenStack or open source services not needed that would ordinarily
   run on the deployment group.

   For example, to add a new deployment group with nova\_api and
   cinder\_api services reconfigure the ``openstack_config`` file:

   .. code-block:: ini

      os-infra_hosts:
         my_new_node:
           ip: 3.4.5.6
           affinity:
             glance_container: 0
             heat_apis_container: 0
             heat_engine_container: 0
             horizon_container: 0
             nova_api_metadata_container: 0
             nova_cert_container: 0
             nova_conductor_container: 0
             nova_scheduler_container: 0
             nova_console_container: 0

   *``my_new_node``* is the name for the new deployment group.
   *``ip 3.4.5.6``* is the ip address assigned to the new deployment
   group.

#. As another example, a new deployment group that houses the
   ``cinder_api`` would have the following values:

   .. code-block:: ini

      storage-infra_hosts:
         my_new_node:
           ip: 3.4.5.6
           affinity:
           cinder_api_container: 0

   The ``storage-infra_host`` contains only the ``cinder_api`` services.
