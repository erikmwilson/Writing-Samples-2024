=======================
 Archiving a container
=======================

If a container experiences a problem and needs to be deactivated, it is
possible to flag the container as inactive, and archive it in the
``/tmp`` directory.

#. Change into the playbooks directory.

#. Run the **openstack-ansible** with the **-e** argument, and replace
   *``HOST_NAME``* and *``          CONTAINER_NAME``* options with the
   applicable host and container names.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack-ansible -e \
      "host_group=HOST_NAME,container_name=CONTAINER_NAME" \
      setup/archive-container.yml

   By default, Ansible archives the container contents to the ``/tmp``
   directory on the host machine.
