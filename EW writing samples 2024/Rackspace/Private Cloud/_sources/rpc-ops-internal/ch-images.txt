Images
=======

An image represents the operating system, software, and any settings
that instances may need depending on the project goals. Create images
first before creating any instances.

Adding images can be done through the Dashboard, or the command line.
Another option available is the the ``python-glanceclient`` tool, which
can be installed on the controller node, or on a workstation.

Adding an image using the Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to add an image using the Dashboard, prepare an image binary
file, which must be accessible over HTTP using a valid and direct URL.
Images can be compressed using ``.zip`` or ``.tar.gz``.

 .. note::

    Uploading images using the Dashboard will be available to users
    with administrator privileges. Operators can set user access
    privileges.

#. Log in to the Dashboard.

#. Select the **Admin** tab in the navigation pane and click **images**.

#. Click the **Create Image** button. The **Create an Image** dialog box
   will appear.

#. Enter the details of the image, including the **Image Location**,
   which is where the URL location of the image is required.

#. Click the **Create Image** button. The newly created image may take
   some time before it is completely uploaded since the image arrives in
   an image queue.


Adding an image using the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log into the controller node directly to add images using the command
line with OpenStack command line clients. Glance commands allow users to
add, manipulate, and manage images.

Alternatively, configure the environment with administrative access to
the controller.

#. Log into the controller node.

#. Run the **openstack image create** command, and specify the image name.
   Use the
   ``--file <The Image File>`` variable to specify the image file.

#. Run the **openstack image set** command, and specify the image name with the
   ``--name <The Image Name>`` variable.

#. View a list of all the images currently available with **openstack
   image list**.

#. Run the **openstack image list** command to view more details on each image.

    * - ``--is_public [True|False]``
      - Optional
      - If set to ``true``, makes the image available to all users. Permission
        to set this variable is admin only by default.
    * - ``--is_protected [True|False]``
      - Optional
      - If set to ``true``, this variable prevents an image from being deleted.
    * - ``--container_format CONTAINER_FORMAT``
      - Required
      - The type of container format, one of ``ami``, ``ari``, ``aki``,
        ``bare``, or ``ovf``
    * - ``--disk_format DISK_FORMAT``
      - Required
      - The type of disk format, one of ``ami``, ``ari``, ``aki``, ``vhd``,
        ``vdi``, and ``iso``
    * - ``--owner TENANT_ID``
      - Optional
      - The tenant who should own the image.
    * - ``--size SIZE``
      - Optional
      - Size of the image data, which is measured in bytes.
    * - ``--min-disk DISK_GB``
      - Optional
      - The minimum size of the disk needed to boot the image being configured,
        which is measured in gigabytes.

        which is measured in megabytes.
    * - ``--location IMAGE_URL``
      - Optional
      - The location where the image data resides. This variables sets the
        location as a URL. If the image data is stored on a swift service,
        specify:  swift://account:<key@example.com>/container/obj.
    * - ``--checksum CHECKSUM``
      - Optional
      - Image data hash used for verification.
    * - ``--copy-from IMAGE_URL``
      - Optional
      - Indicates that the image server should copy data immediately, and store
        it in its configured image store.
    * - ``--property KEY=VALUE``
      - Optional
      - This variable associates an arbitrary property to the image, and can be
        used multiple times.
    * - ``--kernel_id``

      - Optional
      - This variable prints the image size in a human-readable format.


Troubleshoot the Image Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test the OpenStack Image Service by downloading and running a virtual
machine image.

#. Change into a temporary directory when logged into the target
   OpenStack environment and download a copy of the image:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ mkdir /tmp/images

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd /tmp/images/

   .. code-block:: console

      $ wget http://cdn.download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.2/cirros-0.3.2-x86_64-disk.img

#. Upload the image into the Image Service:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ glance image-create --name=IMAGELABEL --disk-format=FILEFORMAT \
      --container-format=CONTAINERFORMAT --is-public=ACCESSVALUE > IMAGEFILE

   For the arguments attached to the **glance image-create**, modify the
   names of each argument as needed:

   IMAGELABEL
       A label or name for the image.

   FILEFORMAT
       This argument specifies the file format of the image. Valid
       vmdk. Verify an images file format with the **File** command.

   CONTAINERFORMAT
       This argument specifies container format. Use bare to indicate
       the image file is not a file format that contains metadata from
       the virtual machine.

   ACCESSVALUE
       Specifies whether a user or an admin can access and view the
       image. True enables all users with access privelages, while false
       restricts access to admins.

   IMAGEFILE
       This specifies the name of the downloaded image file.

   .. note::

      The image ID returned will differ between OpenStack environments
      since the ID is dynamic and variable, generated differently for
      each image uploaded.

#. Run the **glance image-list** to confirm the image was uploaded
   successfully.

#. Remove the locally downloaded image, since the Image Service now
   stores a copy of the downloaded image.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ rm -r /tmp/images

For investigating problems or errors, the Image Service directs all
activity to the ``/var/log/nova-api.log`` and
``/var/log/noval-compute.log`` files.
