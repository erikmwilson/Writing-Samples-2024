With Ansible, the OpenStack installation process is entirely automated
using playbooks written in YAML. After installation, the settings
configured by the playbooks can be changed and modified. Services and
containers can shift to accommodate certain environment requirements.
Scaling services is achieved by adjusting services within containers, or
adding new deployment groups. It is also possible to destroy containers
if needed after changes and modifications are complete.
