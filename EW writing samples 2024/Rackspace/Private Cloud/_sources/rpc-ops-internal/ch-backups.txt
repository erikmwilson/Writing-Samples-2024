Backups for running volumes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A non-intrusive backup option allows backups for running volumes that
are currently in use by an instance. Users no longer need to wait for
volumes to move into an available state before completing
a backup. This option represents an alternative to the method of
creating a backup based on a clone of a volume.

   .. note::

      Set the ``--force`` flag to ``TRUE`` in the ``cinder.conf`` file
      to enable backups of in-use volumes. Cinder will reject the
      request if this variable remains blank or set to ``FALSE``.

#. Ensure that the ``backup_use_temp_snapshot`` option is set to ``TRUE``
   in the ``cinder.conf`` file on any Cinder Drivers that implement
   snapshot attachment.

#. Execute the ``cinder backup-create`` command with ``--incremental``
   and ``--force`` arguments. Ensure the volume name is included in
   this command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cinder backup-create --incremental --force <volume name>


Backups in Customer data centers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers are responsible for backing up data when hosted in their data
centers. Back up the following directories:

-  ``/openstack/backup``: The data inside the containers, including the
   Galera database.

-  ``/opt``: The Ansible source code.

-  ``/etc``: The Ansible and host configurations.

    .. warning::

       Failure to periodically back up these directories can result in
       irrecoverable data loss and inability to manage the environment.

To enable the recovery of instance data, back up the Glance backend. It
is recommended to set an automatic snapshot schedule for instances and
set the scheduler to delete old snapshots. If you use Cinder volumes,
also back up that data.

Comprehensive backups are an important part of disaster planning.
Include planning for Netapp, NFS shares, or Cloud Files if used. For
example, Netapp uses ``/var/lib/glance/`` for the image store.

Backups in Rackspace data centers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 .. note::

    This section is for Rackspace only, and does not appear in the
    customer-facing version of the document.

Rackspace manages backups for Core Support customers when their clouds
are hosted in Rackspace data centers. Backups must be configured after
the cloud setup is complete. This section documents the contents and
configuration for Rackspace backups.

Contents of backups
-------------------

The following information is backed up:

-  ``/openstack/backup``: The data inside the containers, including the
   Galera database.

-  ``/opt``: The Ansible source code.

-  ``/etc``: The Ansible and host configurations.

Glance images are not included in these backups, since they are no
longer included on infrastructure nodes. Instead, glance images may be
hosted in Cloud Files, a local OpenStack Object Storage cloud, or in
NetApp. Regardless of glance back-end, ensure that customer expectations
are clear regarding the lifespan and backup of images.

 .. note::

    Elasticsearch is not currently backed up. Refer to
    `openstack-ansible bug 1400440
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1400440>`__
    for more information.


Backup configuration
--------------------

Host backup configuration is executed by the Ansible playbooks. The
playbooks configure a cron job, which generates a file dump onto the
host devices that contains the data that needs to be backed up.

Each container includes a backup directory called ``/var/backup``. This
directory is bind-mounted to the ``/openstack/backup/container_name``
directory on the host. Backing up the complete ``/openstack/backup``
directory ensures that all relevant container data is included.

You must configure the ServiceNet IP address route from CORE as a static
route.


Creating an MBU ticket
----------------------

When the environment is ready, send a ticket to Rackspace MBU with the
name of the primary infrastructure node. Use the following template:

 .. code-block:: ini

    MBU,

    This is to configure the backup for a RPCO vV.n.n deployment.

    Please install the MBU software on device device_name. This device is
    running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

    Please set the Save Set to the following:

    /openstack/backup/*

    /etc/*

    /opt/*

    Please install the commvault packages on this device.

    Thanks!


Requesting a restore from MBU
-----------------------------

When data needs to be restored on a host, send a ticket to MBU. The
ticket must include the following information:

-  Server name

-  Date of data

-  Exact path of the data that needs to be restored

-  Location where the data should be restored to

   If a location is not provided, one of the following defaults will be
   used:

   ``drive_letter:\rs-pkgs\restore_ticket_number``

   or

   ``/home/rack/restore_ticket-number``

-  Any special instructions

   For example: "Replay transaction logs; wait until 6pm CST to start
   the restore process; call upon completion".
