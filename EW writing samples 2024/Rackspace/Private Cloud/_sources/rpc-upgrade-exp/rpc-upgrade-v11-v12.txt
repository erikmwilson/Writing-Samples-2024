:deconsttitle: Upgrading from v11 (Kilo) to v12 (Liberty)

==========================================
Upgrading from v11 (Kilo) to v12 (Liberty)
==========================================


Release highlights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Over 3500 bugs resolved in this latest release as well as additional
  enhancements to the existing supported feature set of OpenStack
  projects deployed as part of the Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By
  OpenStack (RPCO) solution.

- **Enhanced Manageability** – The new version adds role-based access
  control (RBAC) for the Heat orchestration and Neutron networking
  projects. These controls allow customers to fine tune security
  settings at all levels of network and orchestration functions and
  APIs.

- **Simplified Scalability** – Users will see improvements in the
  scalability and performance of the Dashboard (horizon), Networking (neutron),
  Block Storage (cinder) services and improvements to the Compute (nova)
  service upgrade.

- **Orchestration** – Enhancements to the Heat orchestration project
  adds dozens of new resources for management, automation and
  orchestration of the expanded capabilities in Liberty.


What to expect during the upgrade process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace recommends a six (6) hour maintenance window. Six hours
was the average maintenance window time needed to upgrade from Kilo to
Liberty.

It is important to understand that maintenance window time is **not**
the same as down time.

Internally, Rackspace uses the following **estimates**:

.. list-table:: Upgrade estimates with OS/Host patching
   :widths: 30 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Upgrade time
   * - Pre-deployment checks
     - 0.5 hour
   * - OpenStack upgrade
     - 2.5 hours
   * - Infra nodes reboot
     - 1 - 1.5 hours (Reboot one node at a time. Neutron L3 impact expected.)
   * - Post-deployment checks
     - 0.5 - 1 hour
   * - Nova host reboot
     - 0.5 hour (Reboot all hosts at the same time. At least 20 minutes per
       batch of hosts is needed.)

Overall maintenance is expected to complete within a 5.5 - 6.5 hour window with
no impact to customer instances except Neutron L3 service restarts.

   * - OpenStack upgrade

   * - Post-deployment checks

Overall maintenance is expected to complete within 4 - 4.5 hour window with
no impact to customer instances except Neutron L3 service restarts.

.. note::

   Upgrading multi-region Object Storage (swift) increases the average
   upgrade time.

.. note::

   When using Networking (neutron) L3 features (Router and Floating IP
   addresses), intermittent instance networking communication to
   external networks or router-attached networks will be impacted due
   to service restarts.
