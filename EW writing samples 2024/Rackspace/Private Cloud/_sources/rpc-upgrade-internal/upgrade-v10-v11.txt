=======================
Upgrade from v10 to v11
=======================

Follow these procedures to upgrade an RPC deployment from version 10 to
version 11. A single script named ``upgrade.sh`` performs the majority
of operations to upgrade RPCO from version 10 to 11.

The base directory for the upgrade is the
``/opt/openstack-ansible/rpc_deployment`` Juno deployment directory. Use
``/opt/os-ansible-deployment`` if your environment does not use the
updated openstack-ansible repository name.
