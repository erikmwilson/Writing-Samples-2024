Compute service upgrade notes
=============================

When you upgrade the Compute (nova) service from v12 to v13 in
RPCO, consider the following information:

-  **Aggregates and the scheduler service**: When the scheduler service first
   starts in v13, UUIDs are generated for all defined aggregates and are saved
   back to the database. If you have a significant number of aggregates,
   the scheduler start might be delayed while the work is completed. The delay
   should be minor for most deployments.

-  **force_config_drive value**: The ``force_config_drive`` configuration
   option provided an ``always`` value that was deprecated in the previous
   release. The ``always`` value is no longer accepted. Deployments that use
   that value must change the value to ``True`` before upgrading.

-  **Change-id and backups**: The commit with the
   ``Idd4bbbe8eea68b9e538fa1567efd304e9115a02a`` change-id requires that the
   ``nova_api`` database is set up and that nova is configured to use it. The
   ``os_nova`` role handles this. However, if the deployment uses a nonstandard
   backup mechanism, you might want to update the backup to include this
   database.
