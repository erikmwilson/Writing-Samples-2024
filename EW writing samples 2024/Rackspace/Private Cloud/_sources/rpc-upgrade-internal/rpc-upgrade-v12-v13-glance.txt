Image service upgrade notes
===========================

When you update the Image (glance) service from v12 to v13 in
RPCO, consider the following information:

-  **Changes to heat templates**: Metadata definitions previously associated
   with ``OS::Nova::Instance`` have changed to be associated with
   ``OS::Nova::Server`` to align with heat and Searchlight.

   If you are using ``OS::Nova::Instance`` in your Orchestration (heat)
   templates, you now need to use ``OS::Nova::Server``. This requirement
   changes when the glance database migrations run for RPCO version 13.1.

-  **Deprecation of the task API**: The task API is being deprecated and it
   has been made admin only.

   The API is enabled in RPCO version 13.1, but it is accessible only by admin
   users.
