Networking service upgrade notes
================================

When you upgrade the Networking (neutron) service from v12 to v13
in RPCO, consider the following information:

-  **MTU value setting**: Changes made in neutron in Mitaka that set a
   network's MTU value in the database when the network is created. That MTU
   value is used for advertisement. With existing networks, no migration was
   created to update the MTU values. The MTU values, therefore, remain at the
   default Liberty value of 0, which means that no advertisement happens
   despite ``advertise_mtu`` being enabled.

   New instances on a VXLAN network come up with an MTU value of 1500, which
   prevents access to them with SSH.

   The upgrade should have already updated each network's MTU in the
   ``neutron.networks`` table. However, we recommend that you verify that
   this has been completed before you start to use v13.

   .. code-block:: ini

      MTU_CHECK="SELECT id, mtu FROM networks;"

      cd /opt/rpc-openstack/openstack-ansible/playbooks
      ansible galera_all[0] -m shell -a "mysql --verbose -e \"${MTU_CHECK}\" neutron"

   If any returned network has an MTU of 0 then it is likely that an
   upgrade step was missed or did not complete successfully.

-  **path_mtu setting**: Setting ``path_mtu`` to a value greater than 1500 can
   cause packet loss even if the physical network supports it. Also, the
   calculation does not consider additional overhead from IPv6 endpoints.

   If you need to override ``path_mtu``, you can do that with
   ``neutron_ml2.plugin_conf_ini_overrides``.
