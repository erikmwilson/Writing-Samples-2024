===================
Perform the upgrade
===================

Run the upgrade script from the original deployment host.

- The upgrade process takes at least 30 minutes depending on the number of
  nodes.

- During the upgrade process, instances may experience a brief
  interruption in network connectivity. This is expected behavior, and the
  environment will operate normally afterwards.

  After the script runs the playbook that creates LXC containers, these
  containers should be successfully created.

#. Update the RPCO repository:

   .. code-block:: console

      # cd /opt/rpc-openstack
      # git fetch --tags
      # git checkout TAG
      # git submodule update

   Replace ``TAG`` with the current stable release tag.

#. Change to the ``/opt/rpc-openstack`` directory and run the upgrade script:

   .. code-block:: console

      # cd /opt/rpc-openstack
      # FORKS=10 scripts/upgrade.sh

#. Confirm the completion of the upgrade process with no tasks
   unreachable or failed.

   If failures occur during the upgrade process, an error message will
   indicate where it occurred, and the playbooks to be rerun to complete
   the upgrade process.
