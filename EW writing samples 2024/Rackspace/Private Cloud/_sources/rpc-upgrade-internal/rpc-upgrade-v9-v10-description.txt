Features
~~~~~~~~

The following features can be enabled. In some cases, these features
could already exist on deployments using later releases of version 9.

-  Add: Block storage availability zones

   To enable this feature, see the `OpenStack-Ansible cinder role documentation
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-os_cinder/configure-cinder.html#availability-zones>`_.

-  Add: Object Storage (swift)

   To enable this feature, see the `Object Storage Deployment Guide
   <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/private-cloud/rpc/v11rpc-swift/>`_.

Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration options require attention. In some cases,
these options could already exist on deployments using later releases of
RPCO version 9.

-  Add: Dashboard secret key (required)

   In the ``user_variables.yml`` file, add the ``horizon_secret_key``
   option with a suitable value. The `password generation script
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/install-guide/configure-creds.html>`_
   can add a random value.

-  Add: Galera wait timeout (optional)

   In the ``user_variables.yml``, file optionally add the
   ``galera_wait_timeout`` with a suitable value in seconds.

-  Remove: MaaS repository version

   In the ``user_variables.yml`` file, remove the ``maas_repo_version``
   option.

-  Remove: the following MaaS checks. These should be removed before
   running the MaaS playbooks; when the playbooks are run, the checks
   and alarms will be recreated.

   -  ``swift_account_replication_check``

   -  ``swift_async_check``

   -  ``swift_md5_check``

   -  ``swift_object_replication_check``

   -  ``swift_quarantine_check``

   -  ``swift_object_server_check``

   -  ``swift_container_server_check``

   -  ``swift_account_server_check``

   -  ``swift_proxy_server_check``

   -  ``rabbitmq_status``

   -  ``galera_check``

-  Change: RabbitMQ and Galera alarm names

   Using the Cloud Control Panel or API, delete all alarms (not checks)
   on each node associated with the RabbitMQ and Galera plugins. For
   example:

   -  ``rabbitmq_disk_free_alarm_status--nodename``

   -  ``rabbitmq_mem_alarm_status--nodename``

   -  ``wsrep_local_state--nodename``

   -  ``wsrep_cluster_size--nodename``

   ..  note::

       The upgrade process generates new alarms.
