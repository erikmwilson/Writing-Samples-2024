RabbitMQ upgrade notes
======================

RPCO v10.1.7 and v11.0.2 and later provide a configuration setting that
determines how RabbitMQ recovers from a network partition. For more
information, see `rabbitmq.com/partitions.html
<http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html>`_.

The RabbitMQ default setting for handling a network partition is
``ignore``. Beginning with RPCO v10.1.7, the
``rabbitmq_cluster_partition_handling`` variable is ``pause_minority``.
With this setting, nodes in a single partition continue to run in the
event of a partition. RabbitMQ automatically pauses cluster nodes that
are in a minority as soon as a network partition starts and restarts
them after the partition ends.

Evaluate this setting and ensure it is appropriate for the deployment.
To apply this change after an upgrade, simply restart RabbitMQ. You
should use a maintenance window to minimize interruption of service.

To restart RabbitMQ, use the ``rabbitmq-restart`` tag while applying the
updated configuration from the ``playbooks`` directory, as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd /opt/rpc-openstack/openstack-ansible/playbooks
   $ openstack-ansible rabbitmq-install.yml -t \
   rabbitmq-restart

Alternatively, restart individual RabbitMQ processes by one at a time by
specifying a host append:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack-ansible rabbitmq-install.yml -t \
     rabbitmq-restart --limit ${INFRA_HOST}
