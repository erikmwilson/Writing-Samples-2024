Object Storage multi-region deployments upgrade notes
=====================================================

While Object Storage (swift) can run with different
versions of OpenStack in each region, it is recommended
that the versions are in sync.

To minimize the period where the Object Storage versions are
different across regions, upgrade the regions separately
excluding Object Storage. Coordinate the upgrade of
Object Storage in the different regions so that there is
no overlap on the ring/key sync.


#. Complete a full RPCO upgrade on both regions,
   **excluding** Object Storage. This can be done
   simultaneously, or whenever is suitable for both
   regions.

   - To exclude Object Storage, set ``DEPLOY_SWIFT`` to ``no``
     in the `rpc-openstack/scripts/deploy.sh
     <https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/blob/master/scripts/deploy.sh#L15>`_
     file.

   - Complete the upgrade prerequisites and run the
     ``upgrade.sh`` script to upgrade RPCO without
     Object Storage.

   - Complete the upgrade for both regions.

#. Run the ``os-swift-setup.yml`` playbook on both regions. This
   can be done simultaneously.

#. Run the ``os-swift-sync.yml`` playbook on region A.

#. When the upgrade is complete for region A, run the
   ``os-swift-sync.yml`` playbook on region B.
