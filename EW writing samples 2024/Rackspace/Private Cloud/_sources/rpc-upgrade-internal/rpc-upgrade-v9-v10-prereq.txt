.. warning::

   Read the `RPCO Release Notes
   <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/private-cloud/rpc/v10rpc-v10-releasenotes-external/>`_
   before beginning the upgrade. The *Release
   Notes* provide the latest information about known issues and workarounds.

#. Perform a full backup of the environment including the source
   repository.

#. Clone the version 10 source repository into the ``/opt`` directory:

   .. code-block:: console

      # cd /opt
      # git clone -b TAG
      https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible.git

   Replace *TAG* with the current stable release tag.

#. Review the new configuration files in the
   ``/opt/openstack-ansible/etc/rpc_deploy`` directory. Compare them
   with the existing configuration files in the ``/etc/rpc_deploy``
   directory and with the *Release Notes* to determine new features,
   improvements, and changes.

#. For typical deployments, update the existing ``rpc_user_config.yml``
   and ``user_variables.yml`` files in the ``/etc/rpc_deploy`` directory
   and copy the new ``rpc_environment.yml`` file into the
   ``/etc/rpc_deploy`` directory.

   ..  note::

       New features might require defining additional passwords in the
       ``user_variables.yml`` file.
