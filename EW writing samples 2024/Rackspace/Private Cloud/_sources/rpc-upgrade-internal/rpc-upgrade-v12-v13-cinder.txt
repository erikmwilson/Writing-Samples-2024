Block Storage service upgrade notes
===================================

When you upgrade the Block Storage (cinder) service from v12 to v13 in RPCO,
consider the following information:

-  **Orphaned backups**: During a live upgrade from Liberty, if a backup
   service is stopped while it is processing a restore request, that backup
   status might not be automatically cleared on the service restart. You must
   clean up such orphaned backups manually.

-  **Quota reservations**: When performing a live upgrade from Liberty, retype
   calls might reserve additional quota. Because quota reservations are
   invalidated after 24 hours by default (configuration option
   ``reservation_expire=86400``), we recommend either decreasing that time or
   watching for unused quota reservations manually during the upgrade process.

-  **Nested quotas**: Nested quotas are no longer the default, but you can
   configure that behavior by setting
   ``quota_driver = cinder.quota.NestedDbQuotaDriver``.

-  **LVMISCSIDriver removal**: Before the Mitaka release, LVM configurations of
   cinder might have used ``LVMISCSIDriver`` as follows:

   .. code-block:: ini

      # All given backend(s)
      [lvm]
      volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.lvm.LVMISCSIDriver

   Mitaka removed that driver name and replaced it with ``LVMVolumeDriver``.
   You must ensure that the proper variable is set prior to upgrading.
   Otherwise, ``cinder-volume`` does not start.
