Actions performed by upgrade script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the actions that are performed by the upgrade
script.

.. warning::

   Do **not** actually perform these actions. This list is provided for
   reference only.

**File and configuration changes**

-  The upgrade process modifies files residing in ``/etc/openstack_deploy``
   directory in order to reflect new Liberty values.

-  Some flag files are created by the migration scripts in order to achieve
   idempotency. These files are placed in the `/etc/openstack_deploy.KILO`
   directory.

**Other changes and actions**

-  MariaDB upgrade:
   The version of MariaDB is upgraded from the 5.5 series to 10.0 in Liberty.
   These changes are facilitated directly by the MariaDB/Galera roles
   themselves.
   For more details, see `repo-server-pip-conf-removal.yml
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/liberty/upgrade-guide/upgrade-playbooks.html#setup-infra-playbook>`_.

-  RabbitMQ upgrade
   The RabbitMQ server can be upgraded during an OpenStack-Ansible upgrade.
   When upgrading from an early Kilo release, the update will be mandatory.
   For more details, see `repo-server-pip-conf-removal.yml
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/liberty/upgrade-guide/upgrade-playbooks.html#setup-infra-playbook>`_.

-  Neutron Port Security
   OpenStack-Ansible enabled Neutronâ€™s ML2 port security driver by default in
   Liberty, but will keep the driver disabled in environments upgraded from
   Kilo unless it has already been enabled in Kilo.
   For more details, see `disable-neutron-port-security.yml <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/liberty/upgrade-guide/upgrade-playbooks.html#neutron-port-sec-playbook>`_.

-  Ceph roles are acquired with ansible-galaxy instead of using submodules.

-  Repo build of RPCO-specific packages is done as part of OSA build
   repo build instead of as a clone.

-  The upgrade script is able to specify additional pip packages to load onto
   the repo server.
