Upgrade overview
================

Follow the procedures in this guide to upgrade a Rackspace Private Cloud
Powered By OpenStack (RPCO) deployment from major release to major release.

Before you begin an upgrade, be aware the following considerations:

-  Before you can upgrade to the current major release, you must upgrade to
   the last minor release of the previous major release. For example, to
   upgrade from v12 to v13, upgrade to the latest v12.x release, and
   then upgrade to v13.

-  You cannot upgrade more than one major release, between nonsequential
   major releases, or from version 4. Contact Rackspace Support for further
   assistance.

-  The upgrade process interrupts cloud management, including API access and
   the Dashboard. However, cloud instances and services such as networking
   and storage should continue to operate normally. Inform users of the
   potential impacts of the upgrade process before beginning the upgrade.
