Actions performed by upgrade script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the actions that are performed by the upgrade
script.

.. warning::

   Do **not** actually perform these actions. This list is provided for
   reference only.

**File and configuration changes**

-  Deploys the Ansible bootstrap script. This enables the
   **openstack-ansible** command wrapper. This command ensures that all
   variable files are included when running openstack-ansible playbooks.
   This command should always be used instead of **ansible-playbook**.

-  Copies configuration files from the ``/etc/rpc_deploy`` directory to
   the ``/etc/openstack_deploy`` directory and rename the original
   directory to ``/etc/rpc_deploy.OLD``.

-  Renames ``rpc_*`` files to ``openstack_*``.

-  Creates the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d`` and
   ``/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d`` directories.

-  Adds ``beaver.yml``, which is a new playbook for distributed
   multi-line log shipping:

-  Moves MaaS and other Rackspace variables from the
   ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_secrets.yml`` and
   ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`` files to the
   ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_extras_variables.yml`` and
   ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_extra_secrets.yml`` files.

**Container changes**

-  Removes the following defunct containers from the inventory:

   - ``rsyslog_all``

   - ``nova_api_ec2``

   - ``nova_spice_console``

-  Upgrades containers and services that reside directly on target
   hosts.

**Other changes and actions**

-  Backs up the ``/etc/rpc_deploy`` directory in the
   ``pre-upgrade-backup.tgz`` file.

   ..  note::

       The script does not back up configuration files in containers.

-  The Apache configuration implements ``SSLCACertificateFile``,
   replacing ``SSLCACertificatePath``, which ensures browsers receive
   appropriate signing certificates.

-  The ``OS_AUTH_URL`` is updated to the Identity v3 internal endpoint
   for MaaS checks.

-  Performs a full update of RabbitMQ, including:

   -  Sets the variable controls value to true and running the
      RabbitMQ playbook to shut down the cluster and upgrade RabbitMQ.

   -  Sets the ``rabbitmq_ignore_version_state`` variable controls to
      true, so you can re-run the playbooks in an environment where the
      playbooks were upgraded and the default version of RabbitMQ
      changed within the role. From here, you can re-cluster an
      environment as needed without affecting the package state.

   -  Sets the primary cluster node in an environment and determines the
      restart order of RabbitMQ nodes.

Changes to cinder-volume in RPCO v11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, RPCO v11 deploys the ``cinder-volume`` service on bare
metal. However, if the RPCO version 10 deployment to be upgraded
installed the ``cinder-volume`` service inside an LXC container, this
configuration is preserved and bare metal is not used. The default
location for the ``cinder-scheduler`` service is the
``cinder_scheduler_container`` container on the ``storage-infra_hosts``
host.

The location of ``cinder-volume`` is managed in the
``etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/cinder.yml`` file, and may need to be
edited depending on environment requirements.

-  When using LVM as a cinder back end, it is recommended to run the
   ``cinder-volume`` service on metal (the default).

-  When using the NFS or NetApp driver, it is recommended to disable
   bare metal deployment by removing ``is_metal: true`` from the
   ``etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/cinder.yml`` file so that the service is
   installed into an LXC container. Note that changing the deployment
   location after installation requires you to migrate the volumes.
