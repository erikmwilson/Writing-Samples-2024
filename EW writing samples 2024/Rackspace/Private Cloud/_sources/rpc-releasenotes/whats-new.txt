Block Storage service (cinder)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prelude
-------
  - Project release notes:
    http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/cinder/newton.html


Features
--------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/620

- Generic volume groups

  - This feature adds the ability to create groups of volumes and
    create snapshots of groups of volumes. Volume groups are more
    generic than consistency groups, which are only supported by a
    small number of backends. Volume groups allow operations to be
    executed against a number of volumes at the same time.

  - The ``create/delete/update/list/show`` APIs are now supported for
    groups.

  - To use this feature, a customer must have a previously unencrypted
    volume to be encrypted, or vice versa.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/621

- Volume encryption, retype support

  - This feature adds the ability to migrate or retype volumes to
    either unencrypted or encrypted states. You can reconfigure an
    environment to use encryption best practices.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/622

- Supported driver checks

  - This feature adds a flag for each driver in use. If a driver no
    longer meets the Block Storage community testing standards, the
    driver supported flag is set to ``False``.

  - Supported status is checked when the ``cinder-volume`` service
    starts. If the status is ``False``, an error is logged. If
    ``enable_unsupported_driver = False`` is set and the driver status
    is ``False``, the driver will not start.


Unsupported
-----------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/619

- [Not supported in RPCO] Hybrid aggregate support for NetApp cDot

  - Hybrid aggregates (Flash Pools) are now available when using a
    NetApp FAS with cDot as a Block Storage backend.

  - This feature supports a customer carrying out the same operation,
    at the same time, against multiple volumes. Some, but not all, of
    the backends hosting these volumes support consistency group
    operations.

  - To use this feature, the customer must have a NetApp FAS with SSDs
    or HDDs.



Compute service (nova)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prelude
-------

- Project release notes:
  https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/nova/newton.html


Critical
--------

- The 2.37 micro version requires that the API server create request
  body includes ``networks``. Specifying ``networks:auto`` is similar
  to not requesting specific networks when creating a server before
  version 2.37.

- Compute requires the Glance v2 API.


Upgrade
-------

- The default value of the ``live_migration_tunnelled`` configuration
  option (in the ``libvirt`` section) is now ``False``. When upgrading
  nova to Newton, all live migrations become non-tunneled, unless
  ``live_migration_tunnelled`` is set to ``True``.

  .. yes, "tunnelled" is misspelled in the code

  - By default, the migration traffic does not go through libvirt and
    therefore is not encrypted.


Deprecations
------------

- All APIs that proxy to other services are deprecated.

  - These APIs return 404 on micro version 2.36 or higher.

  - Use native APIs instead of using pure proxies for other REST APIs.

  - The quotas and limits related to network resources including
    ``fixed_ips``, ``floating ips``, ``security_groups``,
    ``security_group_rules``, and ``networks`` are filtered out of the
    ``os-quotas`` and ``limit`` APIs. Manage those quotas through the
    OpenStack network service.

  - You can only use APIs and manage quotas under micro version 2.36
    for ``nova-network``.

  - The deprecated ``os-fping`` API is only related to
    ``nova-network`` and depends on the deployment.

  - The deprecated APIs are:

    .. code-block:: ini

       /images
       /os-networks
       /os-fixed-ips
       /os-floating-ips
       /os-floating-ips-bulk
       /os-floating-ip-pools
       /os-floating-ip-dns
       /os-security-groups
       /os-security-group-rules
       /os-security-group-default-rules
       /os-volumes
       /os-snapshots
       /os-baremetal-nodes
       /os-fping


- The ``use_usb_tablet`` option is deprecated.

  - The ``pointer_model`` configuration option and the
    ``hw_pointer_model`` image property replace the ``use_usb_tablet``
    option. You can specify different pointer models for input
    devices. The default value for ``pointer_model`` is
    ``usb_tablet``.


Unsupported
-----------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/673
.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/674

- The ``nova-lxd`` LXD hypervisor is not supported in RPCO.


- [Not supported in RPCO] Cells v2 now supports booting instances for
  one v2 cell only. Multi-cell support is planned for Ocata. You can
  prepare for Ocata now by creating a cellv2 by using the
  ``nova-manage`` commands. Configuring Cells v2 is optional for
  Newton.



Features
--------

- Perf event support for the libvirt driver

  - You can use this feature by adding the ``enabled_perf_events``
    configure option in the libvirt section of ``nova.conf``. This
    feature requires ``libvirt>=2.0.0``.


- Two new ``oslo.policy`` CLI scripts

  - The first script, when called as ``oslopolicy-list-redundant
    –namespace nova`` outputs a list of policy rules in
    ``policy.[json|yaml]`` that match the project defaults. You can
    remove these redundant rules from the policy file.

  - The second script, when called as ``oslopolicy-policy-generator
    –namespace nova –output-file policy-merged.yaml``, populates the
    ``policy-merged.yaml`` file with the effective policy. This policy
    is the merged result of project defaults and configuration file
    overrides.


- ``nova-manage`` quota refresh

  - Newton adds a ``nova-manage`` command to refresh the quota usages
    for a project or user. You can use this command when the usages in
    the ``quota-usages`` database table are out of sync with the
    actual usages. For example, if a resource usage is at the limit in
    the ``quota_usages`` table, but the actual usage is less, nova
    does not allow VMs to be created for that project or user. Use the
    ``nova-manage`` command to re-sync the ``quota_usages`` table with
    the actual usage.


- New ``reserved_huge_pages`` option

  - You can use the ``reserved_huge_pages`` option to reserve the
    amount of huge pages used by third-party components.


- New ``soft-affinity`` and ``soft-anti-affinity``  policies

  - These policies are implemented for the ``server-group`` Compute
    feature. A ``POST /v2.1/{tenant_id}/os-server-groups`` API
    resource now accepts ``soft-affinity`` and ``soft-anti-affinity``
    as values of the policies request body key.


- API policy defaults defined in code like configuration options

   - The sample ``policy.json`` file  shipped with nova is empty.
     Editing this file is  only necessary if you want to override the
     API policy from the defaults in the code.

   - To generate the policy file, type:

     .. code-block:: console

        # oslopolicy-sample-generator --config-file=etc/nova/nova-policy-generator.conf



Dashboard (horizon)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prelude
-------

- Project release notes:
  http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/horizon/newton.html



Fixes
-----

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/647

- Consistent bread crumb navigation trails

  - Dashboard now consistently displays navigation bread crumbs.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/navigation-improvements.



Features
--------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/637
.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/644

- **Allowed Address Pairs** tab

  - The ``port-details`` page has a new tab for managing allowed
    address pairs. This tab and its features are only available when
    this extension is active in Neutron. The **Allowed Address Pairs**
    tab enables creating, deleting, and listing address pairs for the
    current port.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/638

- Support for managing neutron L3 agent hosts

  - The **Admin** screen for system information now provides links and
    views showing which routers reside on what hosts. In addition, the
    **Admin** view of routers also provides a list of where the router
    is hosted and the link to see which other routers are sharing the
    same host.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/admin-neutron-l3-agent.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/639

- Scheduler hints added to **Launch Instance**

  - You can use this feature to add scheduler hints to an instance at
    launch. In addition to adding custom key-value pairs, you can also
    choose from properties in the glance metadata definitions catalog
    that have the ``OS::Nova::Server`` resource type and the
    ``scheduler_hints`` properties target.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/640

- Administrator ability to graphically manage floating IPs

  - System administrators can manipulate floating IPs in the **Admin**
    panel.

    - List floating IPs.

    - Create a floating IP from a existing network.

    - Associate, disassociate, or delete a floating IP.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/manage-ips.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/641

- Initial filtering of admin tables

  - This feature provides a configurable setting to require admin
    users to first provide a search criteria before loading data into
    admin views.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/admin-views-filter-first


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/642

- Cinder consistency groups

  - This feature adds two tabs to the **Project -> Volumes** panel.

  - The first tab displays consistency groups. The second tab displays
    consistency group snapshots. Consistency groups (CG) contain
    existing volumes and allow users to perform actions on the volumes
    in one step. Actions include: create/update/delete CGs, snapshot
    all volumes in a CG, clone all volumes in a CG, and create a new
    CG and volumes from a CG snapshot.

  - Policies associated with consistency groups exist in the cinder
    policy file. By default, all actions are disabled.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/cinder-consistency-groups.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/643

- Boot sources restriction in **Launch Instance**

  - The feature allows operators to mark boot sources as available or
    disabled. You can restrict boot sources by setting:

    - ``LAUNCH_INSTANCE_DEFAULTS (disable_image,
      disable_instance_snapshot, disable_volume,
      disable_volume_snapshot)``

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/configurable-boot-sources.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/645

- Restrict CIDR range for user private networks

  - This feature allows a cloud administrator to restrict user private
    network address CIDR input.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/restrict-private-network-input.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/646

- Extra properties in **Project** and **User** panels

  - This feature provides extra data in the **Project** and **User**
    panels displayed as table columns and supported in CRUD
    operations.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/support-extra-prop-for-project-and-user.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/648

- Glance V2 support

  - Dashboard adds complete support for glance v2. Dashboard no longer
    depends on having a glance v1 endpoint in the keystone catalog.
    The feature also provides code compatibility between glance v1 and
    v2.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/649

- Dashboard runs without nova or glance

  - Nova and glance are no longer required to run Dashboard. As long as
    keystone is present, Dashboard runs correctly.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/650

- Support for network IP availability

  - The admin network dashboard now displays IP availability. Two
    columns in the admin network subnets table display the allocated
    IPs in a given subnet and unallocated free IPs for each subnet in
    the network.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/651

- User operation history log

  - This feature logs all Dashboard operations to an external file.

  - For more information, see
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/operation-history-log.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/652

- Limiting **Overview** panel scope

  - This feature adds a new ``OVERVIEW_DAYS_RANGE`` setting. This
    setting defines the default date range in the **Overview** panel
    meters - either today minus ``n`` days (if the value is integer
    ``n``), or from the beginning of the current month until today (if
    set to ``None``).

  - You can use this setting to limit the amount of data fetched by
    default when rendering the **Overview** panel. The default value
    is ``1``. The default differs from the past behavior, which caused
    serious lags on large deployments.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/653

- New logout behavior setting

  - Deployers can set the ``TOKEN_DELETE_DISABLED`` variable to revoke
    a user's token on logout.



Identity service (keystone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prelude
-------
  - Project release notes:
    http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/keystone/newton.html



Security
--------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/661

- Identity service supports encrypted credentials at rest. Credential
  encryption is enabled by default and uses a known encryption key.
  Because the key is known, no additional security is provided over
  prior releases of Identity service. Replace the known key with a
  valid key repository to re-encrypt all credentials with secure keys.
  RPCO does not automatically create or configure this key repository.
  For more information, see
  https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/9a559c730a5854c47f1f7198b46bc8ebf5de4bef/etc/keystone.conf.sample#L598-L610.



Features
--------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/134

- Default token format changes from UUID to Fernet

  - In a greenfield deployment, no additional action is required.

  - For more information, see
    http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-November/106649.html
    and https://review.openstack.org/#/c/326748/.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/657

- LDAP mapping table pre-population

  - The ``keystone-manage mapping_populate`` command pre-populates a
    mapping table with all LDAP users. Pre-population improves future
    query performance. Use this feature when an LDAP is first
    configured, or before making any domain queries and calling the
    ``keystone-manage mapping_purge`` command.


  - For help with command options, type ``keystone-manage
    mapping_populate --help``.

    .. note::

       Pre-population causes the keystone database to grow as large as
       the customer-configured LDAP tree. If all of those users won't
       log into OpenStack, pre-population can be counterproductive and
       permanently degrade keystone database performance.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/658

- Add ``cache_on_issue`` attribute to validation cache

  - This feature enables placing issued tokens into the validation
    cache, which reduces the first validation time.

  - Caching might make debugging a running system more difficult,
    since data might be stale.

  - For more information, see the `keystone sample configuration file
    <https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/9a559c730a5854c47f1f7198b46bc8ebf5de4bef/etc/keystone.conf.sample#L2713-L2716>`_.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/659

- Add ``password_expires_at`` attribute to user response object

  - PCI-DSS support requires this attribute in the user response
    object.

  - For more information, see the `list-users API operation
    <http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/index.html?expanded=list-users-detail>`_.



Deprecations
------------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/654

- The ``keystone-manage domain_config_upload`` option is deprecated in
  favor of using the `domain configuration API
  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/339259/>`_.

  .. note::

     RPCO does not use the new domain configuration API.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/660

- If you customize the ``policy.json`` file, update it to use these
  new variables:

  - ``identity:list_projects_for_user`` replaces
    ``identity:list_projects_for_groups``.

  - ``identity:list_domains_for_user`` replaces
    ``identity:list_domains_for_groups``.



Unsupported
-----------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/655

- RPCO does not support `rolling upgrades
  <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/upgrading.html#upgrading-without-downtime>`_
  of the Identity service.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/656

- RPCO does not support `OSProfiler
  <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/osprofiler/>`_.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/662

- RPCO does not support running Identity service in Python v3. For
  more information about Identity support of Python v3, see
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/python3.



Image service (glance)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prelude
-------
  - Project release notes:
    http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/glance/newton.html



Critical
--------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/627

- Database downgrade ability removed

  - At a project level, OpenStack is dropping support for downgrading
    databases. In this release, Image service removed the capability
    to downgrade its database to an older version.

 .. warning::

    It is highly recommended to back up the database before upgrading
    Image service. Backups provide the only method to revert to a
    previous version of the database.


 - For more information, see
   https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/2f803d3fa9d5870b38b195f91a146db9ef755ed1
   and
   https://github.com/openstack/glance-specs/blob/master/specs/newton/approved/glance/remove-db-downgrade.rst.



Upgrade
-------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/629

- ``show_multiple_locations`` deprecated

  - Previous releases provided two ways to enable multiple storage
    locations to be shown: a ``master-switch`` and a policy file. This
    change deprecates the master switch default (``False``).

  - Prior to upgrading, check to see if this change impacts the
    customer environment.

  - For more information, see
    https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/dbfc121072dff4981532b068bb210f9c73c7b98c
    and
    https://github.com/openstack/glance-specs/blob/master/specs/newton/approved/glance/lite-specs.rst#deprecate-show_multiple_locations-configuration-option.



Deprecations
------------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/625

- Amazon S3 store driver removed

  - Amazon S3 is no longer supported as a backend store for Image
    service. There is no recommended migration path.

  - For more information, see
    https://github.com/openstack/glance_store/commit/4432e60af2a2bdbfc456d8d99d93d1157fc86dcd
    and https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/736.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/628

- Adding locations to a non-active or non-queued image not allowed

  - In previous releases, Image service allowed an authorized user to
    set locations on any image that is not *deleted*. This could lead
    to image data integrity issues.

  - With this release, image locations must be added only when the
    image is either in *queued* or *active* status. Otherwise, these
    requests will fail.

  - Multiple locations must now be controlled via policies. Customers
    using this features might need to set appropriate policies to
    accurately control who can add, remove, or fetch locations.

  - For more information, see
    https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/7c7dd626896d732d75c6b802a33b9462aee885fd
    and
    https://github.com/openstack/glance-specs/blob/master/specs/newton/approved/glance/lite-specs.rst#return-409-if-setting-location-to-saving-or-deactivated-image.



Features
--------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/623

- The ``vhdx`` image format is supported

  - For more information, see
    https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/fc0b47beb60c0dbbe620798665d0e9bab07f7029
    and
    https://github.com/openstack/glance-specs/blob/master/specs/newton/approved/glance/lite-specs.rst#add-vhdx-to-list-of-supported-disk-formats.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/626

- Expired tasks are deleted

  - All Image service tasks are set to expire in a certain time after
    they are created. However, expired tasks were not filtered out
    when a user lists tasks. As a result, a user would see a long list
    of tasks spanning multiple pages. With this change, Image service
    automatically deletes all expired tasks. This feature keeps the
    task list readable.

  - For more information, see
    https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/38563b0555d5974f641cb8fa5a0f197279bed04d
    and
    https://github.com/openstack/glance-specs/blob/master/specs/newton/approved/glance/lite-specs.rst#add-functionality-to-soft-delete-the-tasks.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/648

- Glance v2 API support

  - This release adds complete support for the glance v2 API.
    Dashboard no longer depends on having a glance v1 endpoint in the
    Identity catalog. This release also provides code compatibility
    between glance v1 and v2.

  - New installations of RPC should use only glance v2.

  .. note::

     The glance v1 API is deprecated and marked for removal in
     OpenStack Pike. All existing RPC installations must move to v2.
     See https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/624.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/649

- Image service not required by Dashboard

  - With this release, Dashboard does not require Compute or Image
    service.



Networking service (neutron)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prelude
-------

- Project release notes:
  http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron/newton.html


Deprecations
------------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/666

- The ``min_13_agents_per_router`` and ``cache_url router`` configuration
  options are replaced by the following setting: ``[cache] group,
  setting enable = True``.

- Scheduling of new HA routers is always allowed.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/665

- The ``global_physnet_mtu``, ``path_mtu``, and
  ``physical_network_mtus`` variables replace ``network_device_mtu``.

- The ``is_default`` variable replaces ``default_ipv4_subnet_pool``
  and ``default_ipv6_subnet_pool``.



Unsupported
-----------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/671

- RPCO does not support `Project Calico
  <http://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.0/introduction/>`_.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/669
.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/670

- RPCO does not support OVS.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/664

- RPCO does not support the ``external_network_bridge`` and
  ``ipam_driver`` variables.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/663

- RPCO does not support creating VLAN-aware virtual machines.
  VLAN-aware virtual machines use "trunks" of neutron ports that carry
  VLAN tags from the VM out through virtual switches.



Object Storage (swift)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Container Sync supports syncing SLO objects

  - For more information, see https://review.openstack.org/#/c/348495/
    and https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1605597.

- Object versioning

  - Object versioning supports a "history" mode in addition to the
    older "stack" mode. The modes differ in how ``DELETE`` requests
    are handled. For more information, see:
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_object_versioning.html.

  - Deletion of objects is handled in two different methods. Using the
    header ``X-History-Location``, the current object version is
    removed, but can still be recovered from the archive container. By
    using header ``X-Versions-Location``, the current version is
    removed by copying the previous version over it. The copy in the
    archive container is deleted. If there are multiple version of an
    object, multiple deletes must be performed to remove the object.

- Concurrent bulk deletes

  - This feature allows concurrent bulk deletes for server-side
    deletes of static large objects.

  - Before this feature, deletes were single-threaded and each
    ``DELETE`` executed serially. The new ``delete_concurrency`` value
    defaults to ``2`` in the ``[filter:slo]`` and ``[filter:bulk]``
    sections of the proxy server configurations. This value controls
    the concurrency used to perform the ``DELETE`` requests for
    referenced segments. The default value is recommended. Setting the
    value to ``1`` restores the previous behavior.

- TempURL responses now include an ``Expires`` header with the
  expiration time embedded in the URL.

- The object auditor deletes old tombstones. This ensures that they
  are reclaimed and do not waste inodes.

  - To save disk I/O, Object Storage uses a hash to determine what
    changed so that the replicator knows what needs to be synced. The
    replicator reclaims deleted objects after the ``reclaim_age`` time
    period. Deleted objects are empty tombstone files with the ``.ts``
    extension. If the suffix hash file for a tombstone file was
    calculated before the reclaim age and no object is placed in the
    same suffix, the replicator would never delete them. The situation
    led to many ``.ts`` files consuming inodes. The object auditor now
    marks the suffix hash for reclaimable ``.ts`` files as dirty, so
    they can be cleaned and the hashes recalculated.

  - This feature potentially changes the load on an Object Storage
    cluster. For example, the initial object replicator run can cause
    a spike in disk I/O while old ``.ts`` files (which can be
    numerous) are reclaimed. The impact might be negligible on smaller
    clusters, but can regularly be high in large clusters.

- Atomic object creation in Linux

  - Object Storage uses the ``O_TMPFILE`` flag when opening a file
    instead of creating a temporary file and renaming it on commit.
    This makes the data path simpler and allows the filesystem to more
    efficiently optimize the files on disk, increasing performance.

  - The Linux kernel from 3.15 onward (and XFS) adds support for
    ``O_TMPFILE``, while enables atomic object creation in Linux.
    Previously, the object was written to a temporary folder and
    renamed after the object finished writing. This new kernel feature
    creates a write-only lock in the final destination and links to
    the directory. Writing the object becomes an atomic operation.

  - This change corrects a performance problem discovered in XFS that
    allocated all objects created in the same device-specific
    temporary folder to the same allocation group. Storage nodes with
    kernels newer than 3.15 automatically use atomic object creation,
    but fall back to the non-atomic method if unsupported.

Orchestration (heat)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prelude
-------
  - Project release notes:
    http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/heat/newton.html



Features
--------

.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/630

- Support for conditionals

  - This feature adds condition functions such as ``equals``, ``not``,
    and ``and or``. When added to a conditions section, they define
    one or more conditions that are evaluated based on input parameter
    values provided when a user creates or updates a stack.

  - An optional section condition is available for resource and output
    definitions. Condition names defined in conditions and condition
    functions can be referenced in this section. They conditionally
    create resources or conditionally give outputs of a stack.

  - The feature includes a function to return corresponding values
    based on condition evaluation. You can use this function to
    conditionally set the value of resource properties and outputs.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/631

- Enhanced support for Block Storage QoS and quotas

  - A new ``OS::Cinder::QoSSpecs`` resource plugin supports Block
    Storage QoS specs provided by the ``qos-specs`` API extension.

  - A new ``cinder.qos_specs`` constraint supports validation of the
    QoS specs attribute.

  - A new ``OS::Cinder::Quota`` resource is added to manage Block
    Storage quotas. These quotas are operational limits to projects on
    Block Storage resources. These include ``gigabytes``,
    ``snapshots``, and ``volumes``.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/632

- Support for DNS resolution using internal or external DNS services
  for neutron resources

  - This feature supports internal DNS resolution and integration with
    external DNS services for neutron resources. Template authors can
    use the ``dns_name`` and ``dns_domain`` properties of neutron
    resource plugins.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/633

- New ``max_server_name_length`` configuration option

  - This feature adds the ``max_server_name_length`` configuration
    option. The option defaults to the prior upper bound (``53``).
    Users can change the value if necessary. For example, lower the
    value to comply with LDAP other internal name limit restrictions.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/634

- New template directory configuration option

  - This feature adds the ``template_dir`` configuration option.
    Typically, Orchestration uses the ``/etc/heat/templates``
    directory. This option makes it configurable.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/635

- New ``map_replace`` function

  - A new ``map_replace`` function accepts two arguments: an input map
    and a map containing a keys/values map. Key or value substitutions
    on the input map are performed based on arguments.


.. https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/636

- New ``yaql`` function

  - The ``yaql`` function accepts two arguments: an expression of type
    ``string`` and data of type ``map``. The function evaluates
    expressions on a given data set.
