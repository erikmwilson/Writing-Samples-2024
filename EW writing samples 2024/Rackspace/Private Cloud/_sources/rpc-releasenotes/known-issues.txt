Refer to this page to understand known issues in RPCO release
|release| (\ |version|\ ).

- When running a deployment without swift, ``DEPLOY_SWIFT='no'``,
  the ``repo_server`` playbook fails. To fix this, set
  ``repo_build_git_selective`` to ``no`` in
  ``etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_variables_overrides.yml``.

  .. note::

     This issue is only present for the r14.0.0 release. A fix
     is due to coincide with the r14.0.1 release.

- After a greenfield deployment of r14.0.0, no Holland backup exists,
  because the environment is new. Therefore, the MaaS Holland backup
  check flags a failure status. Create a Holland backup so that the
  backup check succeeds.

- Because ``nova_cross_az_attach`` is set to false in
  ``etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_variables_defaults.yml``, care must
  be taken when creating an instance from a volume. Per the nova
  documentation: "If False, volumes attached to an instance must be
  in the same availability zone in Cinder as the instance availability
  zone in Nova. This also means care should be taken when booting an
  instance from a volume where source is not “volume” because Nova will
  attempt to create a volume using the same availability zone as what is
  assigned to the instance. If that AZ is not in Cinder
  (or allow_availability_zone_fallback=False in cinder.conf), the volume
  create request will fail and the instance will fail the build request.
  By default there is no availability zone restriction on volume attach."
