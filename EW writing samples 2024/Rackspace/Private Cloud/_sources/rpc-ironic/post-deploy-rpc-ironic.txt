Post-deployment image registration and node enrollment
======================================================

Creating and registering images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create images for ironic, you must use the
``diskimage-builder``.

#. Follow `the upstream documentation
   <https://docs.openstack.org/diskimage-builder/latest/>`_ to install
   ``diskimage-builder``.

#. After you have successfully installed the ``diskimage-builder``,
   clone `osic-elements <https://github.com/osic/osic-elements>`_ from
   Github to ``/opt/osic-elements``.

#. Create the deploy and final deploy images:

   .. note::

      The steps below create images for Ubuntu Xenial, Trusty and
      CentOS 7. They are to be run from the deployment host as a
      script.

      This deployment requires raid tools for HP gear. The
      ``IRONIC_AGENT_VERSION`` variable can be set to any stable
      branch, Ocata or later.

      You need to clone `openstack-ansible-ops
      <https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-ops>`_ repo to
      ``/opt/openstack-ansible-ops/`` as it contains resources that
      are needed.

Navigate to ``/opt/openstack-ansible-ops/scripts`` and run the script
``ironic_generate-images.sh`` to create a Ubuntu Xenial image for the
deploy image and Ubuntu Trusty/Xenial and CentOS 7 base images which
will be used for deployment on the Ironic node.


Registering the nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This section relies on hardware configuration that makes it highly
   dependent on the specific hardware you deploy. Keep in mind the
   code examples below may not work for your configuration unless you
   are working with the correct values. Ensure all variables match the
   host.

   If the following commands do not work for your configuration,
   reconfirm the node attributes.

You must inform ironic of the network interface cards which are part
of the node by creating a port with each NICâ€™s MAC address. These MAC
addresses are passed to the Networking service during instance
provisioning and used to configure the network appropriately.

From the ``/opt/openstack-ansible-ops/scripts/`` directory, you need
to modify ``ironic_register-nodes.sh`` to match the specifications of
your baremetal machine and then run it.

.. note

   You can modify the capabilities of the flavor and node, but make
   sure that they match, otherwise you will run into errors.

.. note::

   For more information, see the `OSIC Ansible documentation
   <https://github.com/osic/osic-clouds/blob/master/nextgen/admin-node-enrollment.md>`_
   on how to perform this action on multiple nodes.

   For more information on altering the raid configuration with
   Ironic, see the `upstream Ironic raid documentation
   <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/raid.html>`_.
