Compute considerations
======================

Some additional considerations around compute are listed below. These
actions are not items that can be configured upon build of your private
cloud and must be included in the automation steps used to
create instances.

-  It is strongly suggested to utilize Nova server groups when creating
   farms of instances that perform the same function. The creation of
   server groups allows for the use of Nova Scheduler filters.

-  In order to proper distribute the farm of instances across Compute
   nodes, the ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter filter should be used when
   creating instances and/or define in image metadata.

-  Explore the other Nova Scheduler filters that can be found at
   http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/config-reference/content/section\_compute-scheduler.html.
