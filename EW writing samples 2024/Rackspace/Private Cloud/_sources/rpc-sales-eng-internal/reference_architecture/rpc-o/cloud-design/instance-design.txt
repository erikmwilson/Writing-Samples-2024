Instance design
===============

Instance sizing and configuration is one of the most critical
components of the virtualization design effort because under-sizing
instances creates application bottlenecks and over-sizing
instances creates resource waste. Resource waste becomes an issue
when admission control prevents an instance from powering on, although
there are available resources to be used.
