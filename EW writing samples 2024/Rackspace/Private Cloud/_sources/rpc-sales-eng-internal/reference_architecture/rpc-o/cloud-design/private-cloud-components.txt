Private Cloud components
========================

The proposed private cloud architecture consists of the following
components:

-  RPC Powered by OpenStack (RPCO)

   -  (3) Infrastructure Nodes hosting LXC Containers

   -  (1) Logging Node ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana)

   -  (3) Compute Nodes

   -  (5) Swift object storage nodes

   -  (5) Ceph storage nodes

-  (17) HP DL380 Gen9

-  (2) Cisco 9372PX (aggregation layer)

-  (2) 10Gbps Cisco 9372TX (TOR)

-  (2) Cisco ASA 5515

-  (2) F5 BIG-IP 2000s with AFM (Advanced Firewall Module) with
   F5-UPG-SFP+-R

.. note:: The above Logging Node is intended to aid in the troubleshooting and
          auditing of actions executed within the private cloud. All OpenStack
          services related logs are aggregated onto this centralized logging
          server through rsyslog and ELK stack tools are then used to analyze
          these logs.
