Instance flavors
================

Instance templates provide a number of benefits. First they help enforce
a standard machine configuration during deployment. Secondly they assist
in reducing the deployment effort by enabling an instance to be deployed
in minutes instead of days or weeks. Lastly they also enable scale-out
application architectures to be managed rapidly and in the most flexible
manner possible when associated orchestration designs.

When the flavors are defined, make sure to include the following
considerations:

-  Each flavor should contain additional keys (extra\_specs) to aid in
   flavor management and give the Cloud Consumer a description of what
   the flavor was intended for.

-  Make sure to mark each flavor as public or private. If marked as
   private, access to that flavor must be granted to Tenant(s).

-  Always try to keep the flavor disk size to the smallest size
   possible. If additional storage is needed, use the ephemeral argument
   to allocation additional storage. Ideally this would be accomplished
   by utilizing Block storage instead.

-  Do not be afraid to create as many flavors as needed to accommodate
   supporting the Cloud Consumer.

-  Mapping out the flavors allowed by a tenant ahead of allowing
   resources to be consumed helps in keeping your cloud
   standardized.
