Guest OS images
===============

The OpenStack image service (glance) requires that all images to be used
by cloud consumers be registered. Most images are open source and can be
downloaded from the OS distributor directly. Upon request, Rackspace assists in
adding those images to the private cloud. Image metadata
should be included when creating the image within glance. The metadata
can assist in enabling additional functionality within other OpenStack
services.

.. note:: If you need Redhat Enterprise Linux images (RHEL), you
          would need to have a Rackspace private cloud powered by
          Redhat (RPC-R).
