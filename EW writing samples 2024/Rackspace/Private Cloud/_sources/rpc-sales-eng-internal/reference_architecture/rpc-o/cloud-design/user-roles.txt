User roles
==========

The OpenStack ecosystem contains a number of user roles created with the
purpose of delegating administrative responsibilities. Additional roles
can be created to align with existing support organizations. The roles
in the following table are created with the initial RPC build:

.. list-table:: **User roles**
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Role name**
     - **Description**
   * - ``admin``
     - Complete read and write access to the entire system, if not
       assigned to a particular tenant. The default admin account is
       assigned this role by default and it cannot be changed. Cloud
       administrators only should use this admin account. Tenant defined admin
       accounts would be created for cloud operators.
   * - ``_member_``
     - Grants the user (cloud consumer) access to an assigned tenant.
       The user can then consume resources, which would include
       creating instances, volumes, tenant networks and execute stacks
       predefined by the cloud operator.
