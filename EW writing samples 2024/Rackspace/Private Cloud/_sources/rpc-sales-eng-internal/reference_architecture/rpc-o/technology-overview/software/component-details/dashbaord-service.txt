Dashboard service (horizon)
===========================

RCPO Dashboard provides a graphical user interface for users and
administrators to perform operations such as creating and launching
instances, managing networking, and setting access control.

The Dashboard service provides the Project, Admin, and Settings default
dashboards. The modular design enables the dashboard to interface with
other products such as billing, monitoring, and additional management
tools.

The following image shows an example of Admin dashboard.

The role of the user that logs in to the dashboard determines which
dashboards and panels are available.
