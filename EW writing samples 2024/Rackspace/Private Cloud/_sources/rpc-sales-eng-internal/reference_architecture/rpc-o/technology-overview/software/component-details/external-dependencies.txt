   * - **Item**
     - **Requirement**
   * - DNS
     - DNS must be configured for connectivity between Infrastructure
       controller containers and KVM compute hosts.
   * - Network
     - Network congestion or failure could cause API instability and
       unpredictable behavior.
   * - Time synchronization
     - Accurate time keeping and time synchronization is critical for
       a healthy infrastructure. All components including KVM hosts,
       Server, physical network infrastructure and virtual machine
       guest operating systems must have accurate time keeping.
   * - Staff
     - Properly trained IT staff is critical for the proper
       implementation, operation, and the consumption the RPC
       OpenStack infrastructure.
   * - Policies and procedures
     - The policies and procedures governing the use of information
       technology must be revised to properly incorporate the unique
       properties and capabilities of RPC OpenStack.
