Block Storage service (cinder)
==============================

RPCO Block Storage provides persistent block storage management for
virtual hard drives. Block Storage enables the user to create and delete
block devices, and to manage attachment of block devices to servers.

The actual attachment and detachment of devices is handled through
integration with the Compute service. You can use regions and zones to
handle distributed block storage hosts.

You can use Block Storage in performance-sensitive scenarios, such as
database storage or expandable file systems. You can also use it as a
server with access to raw block-level storage.

Additionally, you can take volume snapshots to restore data or to create
new block storage volumes. Snapshots are dependent on driver support.

RPCO Block Storage advantages include:

-  Creating, listing and deleting volumes and snapshots.

-  Attaching and detaching volumes to running virtual machines.

Although the main Block Storage services, such as volume, scheduler,
API, can be co-located in a production environment, it is more common to
deploy multiple instances of the volume service along one or more
instances of the API and scheduler services to manage them.

   * - **Component**
     - **Description**
   * - cinder-api
     - Responds to requests and places them in the message queue. When
       a request is received, the API service verifies that identity
       requirements are met and translates the request into a message
       that includes the required block storage action. The message is
       then sent to the message broker for processing by the other
       Block Storage services.
   * - cinder-backup
     - Backs up a Block Storage volume to an external storage
       repository. By default, OpenStack uses the Object Storage
       service to store the backup. You can also use Ceph, NFS, or
       GlusterFS back ends as storage repositories for backups.
   * - cinder-scheduler
     - Assigns tasks to the queue and determines the provisioning
       volume server. The scheduler service reads requests from the
       message queue and determines on which block storage host to
       perform the requested action. The scheduler then communicates
       with the cinder-volume service on the selected host to process
       the request.
   * - cinder-volume
     - Designates storage for virtual machines. The volume service
       manages the interaction with the block-storage devices. When
       requests arrive from the scheduler, the volume service can
       create, modify, or remove volumes. The volume service includes
       several drivers to interact with the block-storage devices,
       such as NFS, etc.
   * - cinder
     - Command-line client to access the API.


The following high level diagram shows the relationship between the
Block Storage API, the scheduler, the volume services, and other PRC-O
components.
