==================================
Dedicated aggregate layer switches
==================================

.. note:: (Only needed if using more than two cabinets)

Once an environment gets to the point where it expands beyond two
cabinets, and requires an aggregation layer, then we would add another
pair of Cisco 9372PX; be aware those are PX and not TX. These are SFP
based switches. The Cisco 9372TX uplinks to these using SFPs.
