Image service (glance)
======================

The RCPO Image service acts as a registry for virtual disk images.
Users can add new images or take a snapshot of an existing server for
immediate storage. You can use the snapshots for backup or as
templates for new servers.

Registered images can be stored in the Object Storage service or in
other locations, such as simple file systems or external Web servers.

The following image disk formats are supported:

-  aki/ami/ari (Amazon kernel, ramdisk, or machine image)

-  iso (archive format for optical discs, such as CDs)

-  qcow2 (Qemu/KVM, supports Copy on Write)

-  raw (unstructured format)

-  vhd (Hyper-V, common for virtual machine monitors from vendors such
   as VMware, Xen, Microsoft, and VirtualBox)

-  vdi (Qemu/VirtualBox)

-  vmdk (VMware)

Container formats can also be registered by the Image service. The
container format determines the type and detail level of the virtual
machine metadata to store in the image.

-  The following container formats are supported:

-  bare (no metadata)

-  ova (OVA tar archive)

-  ovf (OVF format)

-  aki/ami/ari (Amazon kernel, ramdisk, or machine image)

     - **Description**
   * - glance-api
     - Interacts with storage back ends to handle requests for image
       retrieval and storage. The API uses glance-registry to retrieve
       image information. You must not access the registry service
       directly.
   * - glance-registry
     - Manages all metadata for each image.
   * - glance
     - Command-line client to access the API.


The following high level diagram shows the main interfaces that the
Image service uses to register and retrieve images from the Image
database.
