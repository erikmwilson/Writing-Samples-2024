============================
Networking service (neutron)
============================

RCPO Networking handles creation and management of a virtual networking
infrastructure in the cloud. Infrastructure elements include networks,
subnets, and routers.

Because RCPO Networking is software-defined, it can react in real-time
to changing network needs, such as creation and assignment of new IP
addresses.

RCPO Networking advantages include:

-  Users can create networks, control traffic, and connect servers and
   devices to one or more networks.

-  Flexible networking models can adapt to the network volume and
   tenancy.

-  IP addresses can be dedicated or floating, where floating IPs can be
   used for dynamic traffic rerouting.

   * - **Component**
     - **Description**
   * - neutron server (neutron-server and neutron-\*-plugin)
     - This service runs on the network node to service the Networking
       API and its extensions. It also enforces the network model and
       IP addressing of each port. The neutron-server and plugin
       agents require access to a database for persistent storage and
       access to a message queue for inter-communication.
   * - plugin agent (neutron-\*-agent)
     - Runs on each compute node to manage local networking
       configuration. The plug-in that you use determine which agents
       run. This service requires message queue access and depends on
       the plugin used.
   * - neutron-dhcp-agent
     - Provides DHCP services to tenant networks. This agent is the
       same across all plug-ins and is responsible for maintaining
       DHCP configuration. The neutron-dhcp-agent requires message
       queue access.
   * - neutron-ns-metadata-proxy
     - Proxies metadata requests to the neutron-metadata-agent.
   * - neutron-metadata-agent
     - Handles the metadata request by getting the information from
       Nova and Neutron.
   * - neutron-bridge
     - Linux bridge plugin.
   * - neutron-linuxbridge-agent
     - Linux bridge agent.
   * - neutron
     - Command-line client to access the API.
