If more storage is required per Swift Object Storage node, you can
attach up to two JBODs (only one JBOD per Swift Object Storage node is
recommended to adhere to the 2 disks per 1 physical core). Each Swift
Object Storage node needs as many storage cards as there are JBODs.
The following storage card and the following JBOD model should be used:

Storage Card: Adaptec PMC 8885Q

JBOD: Supermicro CSE-847E26 3.5"
