======================
Third-party components
======================

Some of the RCPO platform components use third-party databases,
services, and tools.


Databases
~~~~~~~~~

Each RCPO component requires a running MariaDB service. Therefore, you
must deploy MariaDB before you deploy a full RCPO cloud service or
before you install any standalone RCPO component. In RCPO platform,
MariaDB is the default and recommended SQL database.


Messaging
~~~~~~~~~

RabbitMQ is a robust open-source messaging system based on the AMQP
standard. RabbitMQ is a high-performance message broker used in many
enterprise systems with widespread commercial support. In RCPO
platform, RabbitMQ is the default and recommended message broker.


External caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External applications for caching, such as memcached offer persistence
and shared storage and speed up dynamic web applications by reducing the
database load. External caching is used by various RCPO components, for
example:

-  The Object Storage service uses memcached to cache authenticated
   clients, instead of requiring each client to re-authorize each
   interaction.

-  By default, the dashboard uses memcached for session storage.

-  The Identity service uses memcached for token persistence.
