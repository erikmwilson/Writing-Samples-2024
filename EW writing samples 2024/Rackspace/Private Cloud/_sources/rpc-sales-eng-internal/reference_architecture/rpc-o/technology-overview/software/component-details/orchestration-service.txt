============================
Orchestration service (heat)
============================

RCPO Orchestration provides templates to create and manage cloud
resources such as storage, networking, instances, or applications.
Templates are used to create stacks, which are collections of resources.

For example, you can create templates for instances, floating IPs,
volumes, security groups, or users. Orchestration offers access to all
OpenStack core services with a single modular template, as well as
capabilities such as auto-scaling and basic high availability.

RCPO Orchestration advantages include:

-  A single template provides access to all underlying service APIs.

-  Templates are modular and resource-oriented.

-  Templates can be recursively defined and reusable, such as nested
   stacks. The cloud infrastructure can then be defined and reused in a
   modular way.

-  Resource implementation is pluggable, which allows for custom
   resources.

-  Resources can be auto-scaled, and therefore added or removed from the
   cluster based on usage.

-  Basic high availability functionality is available.

   * - **Component**
     - **Description**
   * - heat-api
     - Native REST API that processes API requests by sending the
       requests to the heat-engine service over RPC.
   * - heat-api-cfn
     - Manages all metadata for each image.
   * - heat-engine
     - Orchestrates template launch and generates events for the API
       consumer.
   * - heat-cfntools
     - Package of helper scripts such as cfn-hup, which handle updates
       to metadata and execute custom hooks.
   * - heat
     - Command-line client to access the API.


The following high level diagram shows the main interfaces that the
Orchestration service uses to create a new stack of two new instances
and a local network.
