===========================
Identity service (keystone)
===========================

The RCPO Identity service provides user authentication and
authorization to all RCPO components. Identity supports multiple
authentication mechanisms, including user name and password
credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style log-ins.

By default, the Identity service uses a MariaDB back end for token,
catalog, policy, and identity information. This back end is recommended
for development environments or to authenticate smaller user sets. You
can also use multiple identity back ends concurrently, such as LDAP and
SQL. You can also use memcache or Redis for token persistence.

Identity supports Federation with SAML. Federated Identity establishes
trust between Identity Providers (IdP) and the services that Identity
provides to the end user.

**Federated Identity and concurrent multiple back ends require Identity
API v3 and Apache HTTPD deployment instead of Eventlet deployment.**

RCPO Identity advantages include:

-  User account management, including associated information such as a
   name and password. In addition to custom users, a user must be
   defined for each cataloged service. For example, the glance user must
   be defined for the Image service.

-  Tenant, or project, management. Tenants can be the user group,
   project, or organization.

-  Role management. Roles determine the user permissions. For example, a
   role might differentiate between permissions for a sales rep and
   permissions for a manager.

-  Domain management. Domains determine the administrative boundaries of
   Identity service entities, and support multi-tenancy, where a domain
   represents a grouping of users, groups, and tenants. A domain can
   have more than one tenant, and if you use multiple concurrent
   Identity providers, each provider has one domain.
