=====================
RCPO core components
=====================

The RCPO IaaS cloud is implemented as a collection of interacting
services that control compute, storage, and networking resources. The
cloud can be managed with a web-based dashboard or command-line
clients, which allow administrators to control, provision, and
automate OpenStack resources. RCPO also has an extensive API, which
is available to all cloud users.

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the OpenStack
core services and their relationship with each other.
