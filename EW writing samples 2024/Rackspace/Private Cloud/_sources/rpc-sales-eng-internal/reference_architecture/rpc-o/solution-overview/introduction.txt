Virtualization, cost, ease of deployment, and automation are the key
criteria to meet the growing IT challenges. Virtualization is a key and
critical strategic deployment model for reducing the Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO) and achieving better utilization of the platform
components like hardware, software, network and storage. The platform
should be flexible, reliable and cost effective.

OpenStack is a free and open-source software platform (or framework) for
cloud computing, mostly deployed as an infrastructure-as-a-service
(IaaS). The software platform consists of interrelated components that
control hardware pools of processing, storage, and networking resources
throughout a data center. Users either manage it through a web-based
dashboard, through command-line tools, or through a RESTful Application
Programming Interface (API.) OpenStack.org released it under the terms
of the Apache License.

The OpenStack framework also provides for the separation of hosted
services by Region (a collection of one or more data centers
interconnected by a low-latency, high-bandwidth network) and
Availability Zones (Fault Domain) within Region.
