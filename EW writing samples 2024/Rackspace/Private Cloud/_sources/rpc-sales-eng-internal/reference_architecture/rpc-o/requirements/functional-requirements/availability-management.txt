     - **Requirement definition**
   * - AM4.0
     - The system shall provide availability management including:
   * - AM4.0.1
     - The system is N+1 modeled for resiliency, and availability
       within the application.

       **Solution:** We have built tolerance throughout the design of
       the OpenStack control plane, by providing an HA quorum between
       nodes, and allowing flexibility through a container based
       service model.
   * - AM4.0.2
     - The Core hardware such power supplies, hard drive systems,
       network interface cards, etc. must be redundant and fault
       tolerant to avoid single points of failure.

       **Solution:** We have built tolerance throughout the design of
       the cabs by designing for dual power, NIC, and RAID throughout.
       Hypervisors remain independent so applications will require
       cloud awareness for scaling across nodes.
   * - AM4.0.3
     - The system shall allow for compute isolation.
