=========

A *use case* is a description of how users of the system perform
tasks. Each use case below outlines, the functionality from a user’s
point of view, and the end-result of the system’s as it responds to a
functional request. Each use case is represented as a sequence of
basic and simple steps, beginning with a user's goal and ending when
that goal is fulfilled.
