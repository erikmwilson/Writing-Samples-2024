     - **Requirement definition**
   * - DM5.0
     - The system shall provide data management including:
   * - DM5.0.1
     - The system shall provide logging native to OpenStack.

       **Solution:** Logging is a component of every deployment
       through the ELK stack.
   * - DM5.0.2
     - The system shall provide east/west traffic isolation between
       tenants.

       **Solution:** Layer 2 segmentation is the easiest way to
       achieve this.
   * - DM5.0.3
     - The system shall allow for routing of egress traffic

       **Solution:** The system allows for this by defining
       appropriate security groups and gateways for traffic to flow
       through.
