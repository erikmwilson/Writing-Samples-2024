============================
Network switch configuration
============================

The VLANs previously mentioned must be trunked into the network
switches you are using for RPCO. There are no special switch port
configurations to put in place. The host manages the active-passive
bond.

The following are example switch port configurations for one server
(one of the Infrastructure nodes in this case):

::

    Switch 1:


      interface Ethernet1/11
      description controller1 NIC 0 port 0 bond0
      switchport mode trunk
      switchport trunk allowed vlan <vlan id>
      spanning-tree port type edge trunk
      spanning-tree bpduguard enable

::

    Switch 2:


      interface Ethernet1/11
      description controller1 NIC 1 port 0 bond0
      switchport mode trunk
      switchport trunk allowed vlan <vlan id>
      spanning-tree port type edge trunk
      spanning-tree bpduguard enable
