VIP configuration
=================

The private cloud is configured with both internal and external VIP
front ends. These IPs are used to access the OpenStack APIs, gain
access to the Horizon dashboard, and access the ELK stack. Make
sure to reserve the external VIP address. You are strongly encouraged
to tie the VIP addresses to DNS records to ease consumption.
