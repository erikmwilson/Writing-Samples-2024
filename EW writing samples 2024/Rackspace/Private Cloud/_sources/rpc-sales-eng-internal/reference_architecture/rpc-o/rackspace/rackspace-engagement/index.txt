============================================
What an engagement with Rackspace looks like
============================================

This design is a very generic general solution that takes the very high
level basic requirements for IaaS. For many, if not most companies, they
would need a cloud tailored to their specific applications and
requirements. For that we would go through a process similar to the one below.

Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~

The RPC Delivery Methodology is a core component of the Rackspace
solution design.

Gathering requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within and throughout the RPC delivery methodology we use the “Nine
Block” Requirement Gathering Framework as a core component of the
Rackspace solution design methodology. Within each customer engagement,
the use of this framework may differ. Keep in mind that each
“Block” may not be used to design a customer solution due to their
preferences.

   * - *Service quality management*
     - *Capacity management*
     - *Standard operating environment*
   * - *Service quality management* is the appropriate level of
       performance, availability, and functionality of a solution that
       meets the customer's business and technical needs of an
       organization and maintains agreed upon service levels.
     - *Capacity management* is the processes, policies, and
       technologies, which create and maintain suitable resource and
       service capacity to meet the demands of the customer's business
       in a cost effective manner.
     - The *Standard operating environment* is the standard
       architectures, applications, operating environments, test
       frameworks, methodologies, procedures, and terminologies used
       to enhance consistency and manageability within an
       organization.
   * - **Availability management**
     - **Data management**
     - **System management**
   * - *Availability management* is the set of the processes,
       policies, and technologies that determine the availability of
       IT services as they relate to the business needs of the
       customer.
     - *Data management* is the processes, policies, and technologies
       that control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data
       and information assets critical to the business needs of the
       customer.
     - *System management* is the people, processes, policies, and
       technologies used to manage and maintain the business IT
       environment.
   * - **Continuity management**
     - **Information security management**
     - **Operational readiness**
   * - *Continuity management* is the set of processes, policies, and
       technologies used to enable recovery or continuation of
       customer business processes after situations that impact
       business-critical IT services.
     - *Information security management* is the control of access to
       the customer's information and information systems and the
       protection of these systems from unauthorized access, use, and
       disruption.
     - *Operational readiness* is a measure of an organization's
       existing knowledge and processes as they relate to platform and
       application knowledge, support and escalation processes, and
       over all familiarity with the IT service.
