   :alt: Why Rackspace

We are the leading operator of OpenStack clouds and we provide an
unmatched, industry-leading OpenStack private cloud solution.



#. We eliminate the primary barrier to OpenStack adoption – complexity
   -- by delivering OpenStack as a managed service. Our superior model –
   delivering OpenStack as a managed service – eliminates the challenges
   customers face when attempting to deploy and operate OpenStack on
   their own or when attempting to operate a complex and unreliable
   cloud deployed by another vendor. In addition to complexity, another
   barrier to OpenStack adoption is the lack of operational expertise in
   the industry – OpenStack engineers are expensive and difficult to
   find, hire and retain. We eliminate this talent gap and enable our
   customers to focus their IT resources on developing software and
   features for their customers (instead of managing infrastructure).

#. We design, deploy and operate the most reliable OpenStack clouds in
   the world and we back them with an industry-leading 99.99% API uptime
   SLA.

#. We can deploy OpenStack private clouds in your data center, ours, or
   in a third-party location (colo.), running on your hardware or on
   Rackspace managed infrastructure. The Rackspace managed
   infrastructure option enables you to:

   * Move from a CAPEX to an OPEX-based IT infrastructure expense model
   * Rapidly respond to demand in different geographies
   * Easily solve data sovereignty compliance requirements

#. We have 100x more experience operating large scale OpenStack than
   anyone in the world. We’ve scaled OpenStack to 100,000’s of nodes,
   operate the world’s largest OpenStack cloud and manage OpenStack
   clouds for some of the largest companies in the world. Our
   operational experience and expertise is the reason we’re able to
   deliver the world’s best OpenStack API uptime guarantee and ensure
   your OpenStack cloud can scale to meet the ongoing needs of your
   business. We are the first provider to deploy OpenStack services in
   containers, which enabled us to eliminate the OpenStack “upgrade”
   barrier (moving from one OpenStack release to the next) by providing
   a non-disruptive, in-place upgrade path and enabling independent
   scaling of each OpenStack service.

#. Rackspace offers an OpenStack product portfolio that no other
   provider can match. With one standard, one set of tooling, one set of
   APIs and one platform on which to train employees, customers can
   easily manage applications of all types, across all major deployment
   platforms. The Rackspace OpenStack platform includes OpenStack
   private clouds (located in a customer’s data center, 3rd party
   location, or hosted at Rackspace), the world’s largest OpenStack
   public cloud and hybrid cloud options (OpenStack private cloud in a
   customer’s data center connected to an OpenStack private cloud hosted
   at Rackspace; OpenStack private cloud connected to the Rackspace
   Public Cloud). Rackspace’s hybrid combination helps customers spin up
   workloads in multiple locations using the same tooling (e.g., Heat,
   CLI) and allows customers to adopt Active/Active design patterns for
   their applications.
