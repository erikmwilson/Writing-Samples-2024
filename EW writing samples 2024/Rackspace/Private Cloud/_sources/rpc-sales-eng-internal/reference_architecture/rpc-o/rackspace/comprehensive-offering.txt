In addition to delivering OpenStack as a service, we offer a
comprehensive set of enablement services and training to help you
optimize your environment and get the most from your cloud. Our
enablement services team can help you modernize your applications for a
cloud environment, sync your cloud with your existing authentication
system (for example, Active Directory) and help your team move to a CI/CD
(continuous integration/continuous deployment) model. We also deliver
private OpenStack training courses at your campus (or the location of
your choice) to help ramp your users on OpenStack and get the most out
of their environment.
