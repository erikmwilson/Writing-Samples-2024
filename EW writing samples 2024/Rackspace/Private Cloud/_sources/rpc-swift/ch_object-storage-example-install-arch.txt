Example Object Storage installation architecture
---------------------------------------------------

This section provides an example Object Storage installation
architecture. For more information about the Object Storage constructs, see the
:ref:`definitions for the components<component-definitions>`.

The following diagram shows one possible configuration for a
minimal installation. In this example, each storage node is a separate
zone in the ring. At a minimum, five zones are recommended. To increase
reliability and performance, additional proxy nodes can be added.
