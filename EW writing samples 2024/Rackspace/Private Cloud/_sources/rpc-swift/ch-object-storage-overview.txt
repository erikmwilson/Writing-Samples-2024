Object Storage overview
========================

OpenStack Object Storage (swift) is a multi-project object storage system. It
is highly scalable, can manage large amounts of unstructured data, and
provides a RESTful HTTP API.

Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By OpenStack (RPCO) includes the use of
OpenStack Object Storage for redundant, scalable object storage using
clusters of standardized servers that are capable of storing petabytes of data.

.. _component-definitions:

----------
Components
----------

Object Storage includes the following components:

Account server (``swift-account-server``)
 Manages the accounts that are defined with Object Storage.

 .. note::

    Accounts are the root storage location for data.

Cluster
 A group of servers.

Container server (``swift-container-server``)
 Manages the mapping of containers or folders, within Object Storage.

 .. note::

    Containers are user-defined segments of the account namespace that
    provides the storage location where objects are placed.

Node
 A host machine that runs one or more OpenStack Object Storage
 services.

Object servers (``swift-object-server``)
 Manages objects, such as files, on the storage nodes.

 .. note::

    Objects are the actual data stored in Object Storage.

Proxy node
 A host machine that runs proxy services.

Proxy server (``swift-proxy-server``)
 Accepts OpenStack Object Storage API and raw HTTP requests to upload
 files, modify metadata, and create containers. The proxy server also serves
 file or container listings to web browsers. The proxy server takes each
 request and looks up locations for the account, container, or object
 and routes the requests correctly. The proxy server also handles API
 requests. To improve performance, the proxy server can use an
 optional cache that is usually deployed with Memcached.

Region (optional)
 A logically separate section of the cluster representing distinct
 physical locations such as cities or countries. Regions are similar to zones,
 but regions represent the physical locations of portions of the
 cluster.

Replica
 A copy of an object. By default, three copies are maintained in the
 cluster.

Ring
 A set of hash tables that associate each object to a specific
 physical device. There is one ring per type of data manipulated by
 Object Storage (objects, containers, and accounts). The set of rings
 are shared among every Object Storage node (storage and proxy). Each
 ring determines the physical devices (hard disks) where each object,
 container, and account are stored. The number of devices on
 which an object is stored depends on the number of replicas (copies)
 specified for the Object Storage cluster. If the zones are greater than or
 equal to the replica count, the ring guarantees that every replica is stored
 in a separate zone.

Storage node
 A host machine that runs account, container, and object services. The storage
 node contains the SQLite databases.

Various periodic processes
 Perform housekeeping tasks on the large data store. The replication
 services ensure consistency and availability through the cluster.
 Other periodic processes include auditors, updaters, and reapers.

WSGI middleware
 Handles authentication (usually OpenStack Identity).

Zone
 A logically separate section of the cluster. A zone is a group of nodes that
 are as isolated as possible from other nodes—separate servers, network,
 power, and even geography—to create independent failure characteristics.


-------------
Configuration
-------------

Object Storage integrates with the Compute layer and can be used as a
back end for the Image service (glance), providing a horizontally scalable
store for all image and snapshot data. Object Storage focuses on storing
nontransactional data. Object Storage data (the accounts, containers,
and objects) are resources that are stored on physical hardware.

Object Storage proxy containers are installed on specific infrastructure
nodes. The other Object Storage nodes are storage nodes and can have any
combination (at a device or drive level) of object, container, or
account servers running on them. For example, given two servers with
five drives in each, each drive can be part of the ring for any
combination of object, account, or container (including each having
different storage policies within the object server).

Object Storage uses the following nodes:

-  Three existing infrastructure nodes run the ``swift-proxy-server``
   processes. The proxy servers route requests to the appropriate
   storage nodes.

-  Multiple storage nodes that run the ``swift-account-server``,
   ``swift-container-server``, and ``swift-object-server`` processes,
   which control storage of the account databases, the container
   databases, and the actual stored objects.

The following Object Storage features are not supported in Object
Storage in RPCO:

-  Ring management and ring storage repositories

-  Drive detection, formatting, mounting, and unmounting

.. _system-requirements:

-------------------
System requirements
-------------------

To run the Object Storage service for RPCO, your system must meet the
following requirements.

Hardware
 Each node in the cluster should meet the following *minimum*
 specifications:

 -  Six SAS drives of at least 1 TB capacity each

 -  One core for every 3 TB of drive capacity

 -  Two GB RAM, plus an additional 250 MB RAM for every TB of drive
    capacity

 The amount of disk space depends on how much can fit into the rack
 efficiently.

 Object Storage is designed to run on commodity hardware. At Rackspace,
 storage servers are generic 4U servers with 24 2-TB SATA drives and 8
 cores of processing power. RAID on the storage drives is not required
 and is not recommended. The disk usage pattern of Object Storage is
 unsuitable for RAID.

Operating system
 Object Storage in RPCO runs on Ubuntu.

Software
 Object Storage in RPCO requires the following components of Rackspace
 Private Cloud |release|:

 -  Identity (keystone)

 -  Infrastructure services (SQLite database, Memcached, and
    RabbitMQ)

Networking
 One Gbps or 10 Gbps is suggested internally. An external network should
 connect anything external to the proxy servers. The storage network is
 intended to be isolated on a private network or multiple private networks.

Database
 A SQLite database is part of the Object Storage for RPCO container and account
 management process.

Permissions
 Object Storage for RPCO can be installed with either root permissions or
 as a user with sudo permissions if the ``sudoers`` file is configured to
 enable all the permissions.
