Orchestration
=============

|service appformix| provides an OpenStack Nova scheduler filter plugin.
This Python module is installed on the OpenStack controller node.
Nova is configured to use the
plugin to determine which hosts are eligible for an instance to be scheduled.
The plug-in communicates with the AppFormix controller APIs and ensures that
Nova schedules only new instances on hosts that meet the configured
service level agreement (SLA).

Other forms of orchestration are built around the notification service.
The notification service can trigger actions that listen to the alarm
and SLA events.
