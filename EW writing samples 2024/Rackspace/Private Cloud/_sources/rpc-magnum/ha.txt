High availability clusters
==========================

Rackspace RPC magnum supports HA clusters, which provide seamless
failover in the event of a resource failure.  It also improves
performance by distributing the workload across multiple servers.

On a Rackspace RPC Kubernetes cluster, HA resources include:
Kubernetes API, Kubernetes controller manager, Kubernetes scheduler,
and Etcd.  Behind the scenes, magnum uses Corosync, Pacemaker, and
HAProxy to provide HA capabilities.

HA is automatically enabled on a Rackspace RPC Kubernetes cluster.
The only requirement is that your cluster contain 2 or more master
nodes.  Specify the number of master nodes using the 'master_count'
parameter.  For example:

 .. code-block:: console

    $ magnum cluster-create ha_test --cluster-template default /
      --master-count 2

Please note that HA for an application deployed on a Rackspace RPC
Kubernetes cluster is not configured by default and will have to be
set up according to the needs of the specific application.
