Creating a Devstack Magnum Environment
======================================

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Access to Passwordsafe project
   https://passwordsafe.corp.rackspace.com/projects/11853
-  Access to RPC-Magnum Jenkins http://jenkins.rs-magnum.com/

Installation
------------

1. Run the ``Build_Devstack`` job

-  You can leave the default values of most parameters as-is
-  You must enter the ``magnum_dev_password`` from Passwordsafe. This is
   located in the above project under the ``cloud_account`` tab,
   username ``magnum_dev``.
-  You must enter the ``pub_key`` parameter using the public key you
   want to use for ssh access
-  You must enter the ``admin_password`` parameter using the password
   for the ``admin`` user on the dev cloud from Passwordsafe. This is
   located in the above project under the ``openstack`` tab, username
   ``admin``.
-  Other parameters are described in Jenkins, so you will know if or
   when you will need to change them.

2. Follow the console output. This job takes 30-45 minutes to run and
   sets up an OnMetal server configured with Devstack, a version of
   Magnum used in RPC-O and the custom RPC-O magnum driver.
3. The job will display the output for the created stack when finished.
   You will use this information to access the running instance in order
   to debug, test, and develop features for Magnum as well as the RPC-O
   driver

Access
------

Using the ip information from the Jenkins job described above, you can
access the Devstack instance to debug and test both Magnum as well as
the custom RPC-O driver.

You can ssh into the instance as ``root`` to change system level things
and to hack on the RPC-O driver. In order to affect the running
Devstack, you will need to ssh in as ``stack`` so that you can access
the Screen sessions that run the various OpenStack services. You'll
mostly use this to restart Magnum if needed.

The custom RPC-O driver code is located at
``/opt/stack/rpc-magnum-driver-k8s``. You can make changes to this code
and then run ``pip install /opt/stack/rpc-magnum-driver-k8s`` to update
the running code. You will likely need to restart the Magnum service for
these changes to take effect since Magnum loads then caches drivers as
soon as the first cluster operation is requested.

Utilities
---------

A few utilities have been included to make development a little easier:
\* ``/root/create_magnum_devstack_cluster.sh`` will create a Magnum
cluster with default values. Edit ``/root/devstack-cluster-vals`` to
change behavior. \* ``/root/create_magnum_devstack_cluster.sh`` will
create a Magnum cluster with default values. Edit
``/root/devstack-cluster-vals`` to be sure you're deleting the desired
cluster and template.
