Magnum Centralized Logging
==========================

Components
----------

The Centralized Logging mechanism integrated into the Magnum Kubernetes
driver is composed of 3 components:

-  Elasticsearch - To aggregate and store the logs. This runs in pods on
   the Kubernetes 'master' nodes
-  Kibana - To easily view and filter the logs. This also runs in pods
   on the Kubernetes 'master' nodes
-  Fluentd - To capture logs from containers and send them to
   Elasticsearch. This runs on all Kubernetes nodes.

How to use
----------

Logging from a container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to log from a container to Elasticsarch/Kibana, the application
simply needs to log to 'stdout' or 'stderr'. Fluentd will then capture
those logs and send them to Elasticsearch.

Accessing the logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access to Elasticsearch and Kibana are restricted via Kubernetes. In
order to access them, you will need to connect to the Kubernetes cluster
via Kube Proxy (kubectl proxy). Afterwards, you can connect to
Elasticsearch or Kibana by using the URLs below (assuming the default
'kubectl proxy' port):

-  Elasticsearch:
   http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/elasticsearch-logging
-  Kibana:
   http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kibana-logging
