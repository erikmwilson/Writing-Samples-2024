Cluster certificates
====================

The clusters that Magnum provisions have TLS enabled. This document
discusses how client and server TLS certificates are used in clusters.


Generating a client certificate for an end user
-----------------------------------------------

To interact with a cluster, generate a client certificate. Magnum
makes this process easy. Run the following command, replacing
``<cluster-name>`` with the cluster's name or UUID:

.. code-block:: console

   $ eval $(magnum cluster-config <cluster-name>)
   $ export KUBECONFIG=/opt/stack/config


These two commands:

- automatically generate a private key and a client certificate
- get the certificate signed by the Magnum service
- generate a Kubernetes config
- add ``KUBECONFIG`` to your shell environment

Now, you can interact with the cluster's Kubernetes API. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get nodes


Revoking all certificates for a cluster
---------------------------------------

To remove a user's access to a cluster, revoke their client
certificate. There is currently no way to revoke a single certificate.
Instead, revoke all certificates for a cluster. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ magnum ca-rotate --cluster <cluster-name>


The cluster status changes to ``UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS``. After it returns
to ``UPDATE_COMPLETE``, you can generate new certificates using
``magnum cluster-config``.


How server certificates are used within a cluster
-------------------------------------------------

TLS is enabled for communication between nodes in a cluster. Each node
generates its own certificate and gets it signed by the Magnum
service. The CA certificate, the server certificate, and its matching
private key are stored in three locations:

- ``/etc/kubernetes/pki/``
- Base64 encoded in ``/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf``
- Base64 encoded in ``/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf``


The Kubernetes components that use the TLS certificates are:

- kubelet
- kube-apiserver
- kube-controller-manager
- kube-proxy

Use the ``magnum ca-rotate`` command to rotate the server
certificates.
