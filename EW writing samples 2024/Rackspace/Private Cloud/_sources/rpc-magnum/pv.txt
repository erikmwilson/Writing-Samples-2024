Persistent Volumes
==================

HostPath
--------

At present, the only option for using Persistent Volumes in Magnum is to
use the HostPath option within Kubernetes. There is a fixed volume
attached to each Kubernetes Master and Minion that can be used for this
purpose. The volume is mounted at '/k8s\_cbs'. Subdirectories can be
used in order to split this up for use with multiple different pods.
Additionally, multiple pods on the same node can share this storage. The
following caveats apply:

-  Each master and minion has a separate Cinder volume. The contents of
   these volumes are NOT synchronized between nodes.

-  The size of this volume is specified during Cluster Template
   creation, and cannot be resized after the cluster has been created.

-  Any subdirectories must be MANUALLY created prior to attempting to
   use them. They are NOT created automatically.

-  Cinder Volumes are deleted upon Cluster deletion, and are not
   re-attached.

The size of the Cinder volume used for this storage defaults to 5GB.
This can be changed in the Cluster Template definition, by specifying
the 'cinder\_volume\_size' parameter, which represents the size, in GB,
of the Cinder volume.

Example:

::

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: test-pd
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/google_containers/test-webserver
        name: test-container
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /test-pd
          name: test-volume
      volumes:
      - name: test-volume
        hostPath:
          # directory location on host
          path: /k8s_cbs
