Magnum Architecture
===================

Components
----------

Magnum is comprised of two components, the API server (magnum-api) and
the Conductor (magnum-conductor), which is responsible for performing
the stack lifecycle operations, etc.

API server
~~~~~~~~~~

This service is running in the 'magnum' container on all RPC control
nodes. This service responds to all incoming API requests, and performs
basic validation of commands.

Conductor service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This service is also running in the 'magnum' container on all RPC
control nodes. This service performs the creation, update, and deletion
actions that are requested via the API.
