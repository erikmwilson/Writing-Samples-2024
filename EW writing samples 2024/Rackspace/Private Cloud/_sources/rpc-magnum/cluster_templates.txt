Cluster Templates
=================

What are they
-------------

Cluster Templates are used to store settings that will later be used to
create a Magnum cluster.

How do they work
----------------

Cluster Templates need to be created before you are able to create a
Magnum cluster, and must be specified during cluster creation time

What settings can I use?
------------------------

The following settings are available to be configured in a Cluster
Template

-  ``keypair-id``: UUID of SSH Key to be used for Nova servers OR

-  ``keypair``: Name of SSH Key to be used for Nova servers

-  ``external-network-id``: UUID of External Network OR

-  ``external-network``: Name of External Network

-  ``master-flavor-id``: UUID of Nova Flavor that will be used for the
   Kubernetes/etcd master servers OR

-  ``master-flavor``: Name of Nova Flavor that will be used for the
   Kubernetes/etcd master servers

-  ``flavor-id``: UUID of Nova Flavor that will be used for the
   Kubernetes worker servers OR

-  ``flavor``: Name of Nova Flavor that will be used for the Kubernetes
   worker servers

-  ``image-id``: UUID of Glance Image that will be used for the Nova
   servers OR

-  ``image``: Name of Glance Image that will be used for the Nova
   servers *NOTE: The Glance Image chosen needs to have an ``os_distro``
   property that matches the Magnum driver in use. Currently, the
   Rackspace Managed Kubernetes driver requires ``os_distro = fedora``*

-  ``name``: The name to be used for the Cluster Template

-  ``coe``: The name of the Container Orchestration Engine that will be
   used. *NOTE: The COE that is chosen needs to match an existing Magnum
   driver. Currently, the Rackspace Managed Kubernetes driver supports
   ``kubernetes``*

-  ``fixed-network``: The Neutron network to use as the private network
   for Cluster nodes. If this is not set, it will create a new private
   network

-  ``fixed-subnet``: The Neutron subnet to use for Cluster Nodes. This
   is only required if ``fixed-network`` is in use

-  ``network-driver``: The name of the network driver for internal
   Container networking. Valid options are ``flannel`` or ``docker``
   *NOTE: The Rackspace Managed Kubernetes driver requires ``flannel``*

-  ``volume-driver``: The name of the volume driver for Persistent
   Volumes within the COE Valid options are ``cinder`` or ``rexray``
   *NOTE: The Rackspace Managed Kubernetes driver does not currently
   support either volume driver*

-  ``dns-nameserver``: The DNS nameserver to be used on all Cluster
   nodes and containers. Defaults to '8.8.8.8'. This will be used in the
   private Neutron network configuration

-  ``docker-volume-size``: The size of the Cinder volume to be attached
   to all Docker nodes to store images. If the volume is too small,
   users may encounter errors when attempting to pull new images

-  ``docker-storage-driver``: The name of the driver used to store
   Docker images and the container's writeable layer Valid options are
   ``devicemapper`` and ``overlay`` *NOTE: The Rackspace Managed
   Kubernetes driver uses ``devicemapper``*

-  ``http-proxy``: URL, including a port number, to be used to proxy
   HTTP requests

-  ``https-proxy``: URL, includign a port number, to be used to proxy
   HTTPS requests

-  ``no-proxy``: Comma separated list of IP addresses to be excluded
   from the ``http-proxy`` and ``https-proxy``

-  ``labels``: Arbitrary ``key=value`` pairs. These are used to pass
   additional information to the drivers

-  ``tls-disabled``: Disable TLS authentication/security on the cluster,
   allowing anonymous authentication

-  ``public``: Make this template appear to all Magnum users

-  ``registry-enabled``: Creates an internal Docker registry on this
   cluster

-  ``server-type``: Whether to use VM or Bare Metal servers for this
   cluster. Valid options are ``vm`` and ``bm`` *NOTE: Racksapce Managed
   Kubernetes only supports ``vm`` at this time*

-  ``master-lb-enabled``: Creates a Load Balancer across the Master
   nodes *NOTE: This should be used when using the Rackspace Managed
   Kubernetes driver*

-  ``floating-ip-enabled``
