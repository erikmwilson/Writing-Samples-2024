Filtering incidents
===================

You can filter the incidences that are sent to the Rackspace ticketing systems
and filter the Rackspace tickets that create incidences in your
ServiceNow instance.

Filtering incidents sent to Rackspace
-------------------------------------

Filter incidents to determine which ServiceNow incidents are sent to
the Rackspace ticketing systems. Two methods are available to filter these
incidents. Use the following steps for the method that you choose to use.

Method 1
~~~~~~~~

1. Open the Business Rule ``Trigger Check v2`` and click **Update**.

#. On the **When to run** tab, set the conditions for when this
   business rule should be run.

Method 2
~~~~~~~~

1. Open the Outbound Event ``Rackspace Ticketing (Create Incident)``.

#. On the **Outbound Events** window, set the **Conditions** by which
   the event processes incidents.

   You can create a filter by using any incident attributes. For example,
   filters can be based on the Assignment Group or based on the
   Incident Classification.

#. Click **Update**.

#. Repeat for the Outbound Event ``Rackspace Ticketing (Update Incident)``.


Filtering incidents received from Rackspace
-------------------------------------------

You can filter inbound incidents to determine which Rackspace tickets
create incidents in your ServiceNow instance.

Use the following steps to filter the incidents:

1. In Rackspace Ticketing Integration, from the **Scripts and Logs** menu,
   click on **Transform Scripts** to edit the inbound transform script.

#. Add the desired filter conditions to the inbound transform script.
