Authenticate by using cURL
--------------------------

Follow these steps to authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud by
:ref:`using cURL <how-curl-commands-work>`.

- :ref:`Send an authentication request <send-auth-req-curl>`
- :ref:`Review the authentication response <review-auth-resp>`

.. important::

   The cURL examples in this guide are provided for reference only. Because
   the use of cURL has environmental dependencies, copying and pasting the
   examples might not work in your environment.

.. _send-auth-req-curl:

Send an authentication request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a command prompt, send a **POST tokens** request to the Rackspace Cloud
Identity service.  Include your username and :ref:`API key <get-credentials>`,
as shown in the following example.

.. include:: ../common-gs/samples/auth-req-curl.rst


.. _review-auth-resp:

Review the authentication response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your credentials are valid, the Identity service returns an authentication
response that includes the following information:

 - An authentication token
 - A service catalog with information about the services that you can access
 - user information and role assignments


.. note::
    For detailed information about the authentication response, see the
    :rax-devdocs:`Annotated authentication request and response
    <cloud-identity/v2/general-api-info/authentication-info/sample-auth-req-response/#annotated-auth-req-resp>`
    in the Rackspace Cloud API documentation.


In the following example, the ellipsis (...)  represents other service
endpoints, which are not shown. The values shown in this and other examples
vary because the information returned is specific to your account.

**Example: Authentication response**

.. include:: ../common-gs/samples/auth-resp-json.rst

If the request was successful, it returns the following values that you need to
include when you make service requests to the Rackspace product API:

token ID
    The token ID value is required to confirm your identity each
    time you access the service. Include it in the ``X-Auth-Token`` header
    for each API request.

    The ``expires`` attribute indicates the date and time that the token
    expires, unless it is revoked before the expiration. To get a new token,
    submit another authentication request. For more information, see
    :rax-devdocs:`Manage tokens and token expiration
    <cloud-identity/v2/getting-started/manage-auth-tokens/#manage-authentication-tokens>`

tenant ID
    The tenant ID provides your account number. For most Rackspace Cloud
    service APIs, the tenant ID is appended to the API endpoint in the service
    catalog automatically. For Rackspace Cloud services, the tenant ID has the
    same value as the tenant name.

endpoint
    The API endpoint provides the URL that you use to access the API service.

If the request failed, review the response message and
the following error message descriptions to determine next steps.

- If you see the following error message, review the authentication request
  for syntax or coding errors. If you are using cURL, see
  :ref:`Using cURL <how-curl-commands-work>`.

  .. code::

     400 Invalid request body: unable to parse Auth data. Please review XML or
     JSON formatting

- If you see the following error message, verify the authentication credentials
  submitted in the authentication request. If necessary, contact your Rackspace
  Cloud Administrator or Rackspace Support to get valid credentials.

  .. code::

     401 Unable to authenticate user with credentials provided.

..  note::
       For additional information about authentication errors, see the
       :rax-dev:`Identity API Reference
       <docs/cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#token-operations>`
       documentation.
