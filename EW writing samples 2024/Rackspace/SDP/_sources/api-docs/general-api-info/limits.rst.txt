Rate limits
===========

All accounts, by default, have a preconfigured set of thresholds, or *limits*,
to manage capacity and prevent abuse of the system. For example, our Ticketing
API makes use of rate limits, which are thresholds that are reset after a
certain period of time passes. These rate limits are processed by using our
`Repose service`_.

.. _api-info-limits-ratelimits:


Rate limits are specified in both a human-readable wildcard URI and a
machine-processable regular expression. The regular expression boundary
matcher ``^`` takes effect after the root URI path. For example, the regular
expression ``^/tickets/12345`` would match the
``/tickets/12345`` portion  of the following URI:

``https://api.ticketing.api.rackspace.com/tickets/12345``

     - Default limit
   * - GET
     - ``/categories``
     - 60 per minute
   * - POST
     - ``/tickets``
     - 1 per minute
   * - PATCH
     - ``/tickets/{ticket_id}``
     - 5 per minute


Rate limits are applied in the order relative to the method, going from least
to most specific. If you exceed the limits established for
your account, a ``429 (Too Many Requests)`` HTTP  response is returned with a
``Retry-After`` header to notify the client when it can  attempt to try
again.
