=============
Authorization
=============

The user is validated against Rackspace's internal permission systems
when the create and update API calls are made and when the user
associates a resource to the ticket.

Rackspace cannot prevent an unauthorized user from viewing a synchronized
ticket within the user's ticketing system. Controlling tickets read in the
synchronized ticketing system is the sole responsibility of the user.

Optionally, a user’s permission to create, edit, or associate a ticket to a
resource can be enforced by the user’s ticketing and permission
systems for a better user experience.

.. note::

   Rackspace has two permissions systems. One
   supports our dedicated product offerings and another supports all
   other product offerings.

Dedicated permissions
---------------------

If a user wants to create or update a ticket under a particular
dedicated account, the authenticated user needs either the
``Account Administrator`` or ``Edit Account Tickets`` permission on that
account.

If the user also wants to attach resources or update a ticket with
resources currently attached, they need ``Edit`` privileges on at
least one of those resources.

All existing permissions can be viewed and edited within the `my.rackspace.com <https://my.rackspace.com>`_ portal.
