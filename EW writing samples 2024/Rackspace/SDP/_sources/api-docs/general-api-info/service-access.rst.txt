Service access endpoints
========================

The |apiservice| has two environments with global endpoints.

Perform all testing and development against the demo environment.
This prevents test tickets from negatively impacting your support
experience.

Demo environment

.. code::

    https://demo.ticketing.api.rackspace.com

Production environment
----------------------

.. code::

    https://ticketing.api.rackspace.com

The ticketing event feed also has two environments available for use.
Events triggered within the demo environment are published to the
demo feed, while production events are published to the primary
ticketing event feed.
