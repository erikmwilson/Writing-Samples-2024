Request and response types
==========================

The |apiservice| supports the JSON data serialization format.

The request format and resource version are specified by using the
``Content-Type`` header and are required for operations that have a request
body. If ``application/json`` is provided, the latest resource version is
used. To avoid unintentional interruptions with your integration,
Rackspace recommends specifying a specific version header rather than
relying on ``application/json``, as version updates
result in your immediate adoption of the latest version.

You can specify the response format and resource version in requests by
using the ``Accept`` header. If no response format is specified, JSON is
the default and the latest version is used.
