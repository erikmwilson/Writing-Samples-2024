Response codes
==============

Rackspace Ticketing API returns an HTTP code that denotes the type of response.

-  Successful response codes are returned only if all configured
   providers were successful in processing the request.

-  Error response codes are accompanied by an ``application/json``
   response body that contains the error messages.

This API uses `standard HTTP 1.1 response codes`_.

The following table lists possible responses with their associated codes
and descriptions.
