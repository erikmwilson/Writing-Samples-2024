Ticketing event feed
====================

.. image:: ../../figures/ticketing-feed.png

All events, whether sourced from Rackspace APIs, portals, monitoring or
Support Rackers, are published to the Ticketing feed. This ensures that
you and your team are kept up-to-date with your support requests and
infrastructure.

The Ticketing event feed is provided by Rackspace's Cloud Feeds service.
Cloud Feeds is a service that accepts event notifications from Rackspace
products and services, validates them, and makes them available to internal
and external users in a reliable, secure, and standardized way.
