Onboarding
==========

Before you can start integrating, you first need to complete the onboarding
process. Contact your Rackspace Account Manager to help you with the following
tasks:

* If you are integrating Dedicated Hosting accounts, request to have
  these accounts granted the ability to leverage API keys. While this is the
  default behavior for our managed cloud accounts,
  this feature needs to be enabled to view your API key within the
  MyRackspace portal.

* To synchronize events from Rackspace systems, you need a user that can
  authenticate to the Rackspace ticketing event feed. This user can be created
  by anyone with administrative privileges on your account, or you can ask
  your Account Manager to help with the creation process. This user
  needs to have the ``cloudfeeds:observer`` role.

* Provide your Account Manager with a list of account IDs that need to
  communicate with the API and ticketing feed.

Integration
-----------

After your accounts have been granted access to the Rackspace demo environment,
you can begin writing your integration. To avoid unintended interruptions to
your support experience, Rackspace recommends that development occurs against
our demo environment. After you have tested your integration, you can ask your
Account Manager to enable production access.

At a high level, you are using two Rackspace services as complementary
components in your integration. The Ticketing API provides a mechanism to
submit your ticket create and update events with Rackspace.
The Rackspace ticketing event
feed is leveraged to consume any ticketing events that occur within your
account. This ensures that your applications keep informed of any new service
requests, as well as any updates to existing requests.
